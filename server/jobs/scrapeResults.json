So you\u2019re really fighting the flow on this one.If you did the reading, understood the company, understood the various directions GME could take on its new path, and having weighed it up decided that the bearish case still significantly outweighed the bullish case, this is a reasonable YOLO.\n\nBut I don\u2019t think you did.Dude get out right now at least wait until IV settles why are you doing this I genuinely don\u2019t want you to lose moneyat least you have the balls to put the money up and actually post puts.

I\u2019m short 800 shares here. Citron pumping out a bearish tweetstorm at 10:30a est tomorrowValid points. I shorted PLTR under similar circumstances a few weeks back. The stock fell 30% and the puts rose a similar amount, so it hardly felt worth the risk, but it feels good to be right once in a while. I realize I could be right and still lose money hereNo it\u2019s not us I swearYes but I haven\u2019t resorted to intravenous drugs yet, thank you for your concernShe sounds hotMy backup plan is to be dead by 4/16 (points at brain)Has more come out? Should I buy in?Okay MelvinName a time and place big boyI\u2019d be happy to post my PLTR put gains from a few weeks back but no, I don\u2019t take pleasure in other people losing money. Keep buying meme stocks if that\u2019s your thingDude...read the fuckin' roomAnyone quoting GME's business as the primary reason behind the move is an idiot. They've done alright given their situation, but the short squeeze from institutions betting poorly is what's driving it up right now.Wait till this guy hears about omnichannel, streaming, electronic downloads, etcCalling them a video game retailer is so ignorant, first of all, like Tesla, when you have a once in a generation type genius in charge you are investing as much in the person as the company and their products, and secondly Ryan Cohen is going to completely rebuild the business for the digital age, 35-40 is the new floorFrom an options standpoint your break even is around $17. The IV is 170% and delta is only .1. There is support around the 17-18 range. Your best bet is GME crashes in Feb and March, and even then you can lose value in IV for not a lot of delta. \n\nWhy jump in front of the moving train this early?The hive mind is the strength of the sub though?  It is a dumb thing when people pile on insults or something but when everyone is ponying up ducats it honest to god affects the market. There was a post here a couple days ago that did the math on the combined might of WSB autists and it rivals some of the biggest institutional players when the horde is pointed in the right direction.They call that a Mushroom Tattoo in these partsAHHAAAHAHH BAI BAI MONEYLol really is a yolo \ud83d\ude02you only lose it all onceI genuinely hope you make a ton of $$$$$Remind me! 14 daysIdk ask your doc cause this is a retarded playGood point.My smooth brain only knows stonks go up \ud83d\ude80At least you bought far out to minimize IV. But yeah it\u2019s hard to short this stock right now, so it\u2019s a tough one for me. I\u2019ve also been burned on short squeezes before. And in my 15 years of trading, GME right now looks like one of those once in a lifetime events. Never seen short interest this high.Please don't joke about thatI think the squeeze will genuinely start next week.Shorts still haven\u2019t covered even with that last run, and that run is gonna force their hand this next week. This is going to $100 at the least, possibly $420.69 if enough people diamond hand it7:00 behind Wendy's as soon as I get off shift.Immediate defensive attitude clearly shows insecurity with being a \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b.  PUTS ON THIS \ud83d\udc3b\ud83c\udf08 OP.You literally just dumped your life savings betting on a meme stock retard.Stfu the whole point is to make money with risky trades not only sticking to bullish plays.watch the market shift in a year and retards like you are gonna get ass fucked on every play.  \nBe Autists\nNot RetardsI\u2019m having deja vu, stock down 10% and puts up 9%For the record I meant it in a sexual way, not aggressiveNo, just the Roth. And I\u2019ll fucken do it again!!\n\nThe only people being derided on wsb are those who challenge the hive mind. That should worry youIt\u2019s fine I will get lots of sexual pleasure jerking it to your poss porn.Lol we\u2019re deriding you because it\u2019s fucking stupid play that\u2019s gonna lose you thousands of dollars.

I love it when dumb money steals money form smart money. I\u2019ve been bullish on Gme and the time has come, now This shit will crash soon. That\u2019s why I\u2019m saying lock in the gainzzzzpBecause this is nothing like VW short squeeze. Porsche own had like 90% ownership of shares. There still many players they can get shares from to keep squeezingYes it does, this company did 1.4 billion in revenue last year and its market cap was legit 1b before the run up. This is just a correction for valuation the real run up is the short squeezeYou stupid... boomer fucksuck my fundamental peenThe squeeze hasn\u2019t even started yet, they have to coverHey OP can you link to your image? I want to see details.So you don\u2019t think this is moving higher ?Bruh, I'm pretty sure they did 1.4b during the \\*holiday season\\* alone. \n\nTheir 2020 revenue was almost 6.5b according to marketwatch:\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/gme/financials](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/gme/financials)Bonds > gmehttps://fintel.io/sob/us/gme\n\nClick OPT to arrange the calls and puts together. So you can see which institutions are doing whatI think it had the same squeeze it had on November and it\u2019s gonna dip down really quick. I\u2019m betting on another squeeze when news of earnings of Q1 come out. I really don\u2019t see it go that higher. I learnt my lesson of greediness back in November. I got in at $13 and jumped to $22 and I thought it would\u2019ve gone higher just like it\u2019s happening nowProves my point even more, these people just love to hate when we make gains.

    "selfText": "Obviously, $GME Q4 results are a day of reckoning for this business. I have long been tracking this company but I only recently got in with some skin in the game (disclosure \u2013 I own \\~3000 shares; I am also new to WSB:)). I also think Q3 is an important moment for the company given the institutional dynamics, but **I do NOT think holding through 12/8 would be a good gamble** (which is why you are seeing several people sell their shares to buy in later). Instead, I think there is a better way to play earnings on 12/8.\n\nFirst off, as everyone knows, Q3 results are going to be ugly. Some have made the argument that the market has already priced this in, but this is only partially true. **Market pricing is dictated by both event-driven probability and hype.** I would guess that the probability of GME missing consensus estimates is \\~50/50 (note missing consensus estimates is different from negative growth which is guaranteed in this case). Nobody knows where things will shake out, so the market will price it as such. However, there is a tremendous amount of hype around this stock (for good reason in my humble opinion), which is why I think this stock is trading well heading into an earnings announcement for a turbulent quarter.\n\nNow, **one way to estimate performance is by using credit card activity as a proxy for performance**. We can then use this and compare it to consensus estimates by research analysts:\n\n*Same-Store Sales*\n\n* Telsey: -27.0% (as of 12/2/20)\n* Wedbush: -20.0% (as of 12/4/20)\n\n**If you look at credit card data scrapping services, it looks like the quarter will end down around 25 \u2013 30%** (based on the service you use). Obviously this is close to the Telsey number, but its worth noting that these credit card services slightly overestimated performance in Q2 (so the number will likely be closer to -30%). **Therefore, I have a feeling that this stock is going to sell-off significantly**, **making it a much better entry point versus pre-earnings.**\n\n**Personally, I am still long this stock, but it seems like the stock is going to drop in the immediate aftermath of the earnings release, which is why I will be holding off from buying on Monday. I\u2019m definitely going to scoop up some more after earnings however!**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHappy to answer any questions :)",

It might cause the loss of potential profits if you sell and have to average up on unexpected good news. \n\nIf you believe that we will go up, then you'll ultimately get there if it plays out that way whether or not you pull out and get back in.I think weak earnings are priced in despite the run up in share price. Shorts have continued to double down and I think anyone still in it is there for the squeeze. \n\nWhat will likely prevent a broad sell off will be positive guidance which is expected and probably not entirely priced in. I think after Cohen\u2019s letter, management is already shitting bricks so expect a very rosy forecast. I\u2019m sure the CEO is already trying to save his job so the way I see it he\u2019s not about to fuck this up.\n\nPositions: 2900 sharesWe're trying to kick start a short squeeze and you're telling us to sell. Fuck off Melvin Capital! I'm buying GME all month until I'm on the fucking moon \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80I think that Q3 results will be less important than future outlook, because as you said, everyone knows they suffered huge losses. Been in since 12 though, so it doesn't matter much to me. On the slim chance that there is a major shift in company structure or otherwise, getting in before earnings gets you exposure to any of that. There seems to be more upside than downside to me since they are expected to perform poorly, and any deviation from that, or planning for future events, can cause the stock to rise.You are missing something in your analysis that I need.\n\nYou are telling me that puts would be wise. Okay. That is fine. What you're not telling me is whether IV will fall. If the IV doesn't fall then you are better off simply buying puts and converting them into calls after earnings if you believe that the stock will fall.\n\nHowever I have a feeling that IV will *rise* after earnings substantially making it far worse to get in no matter the value of the entry point. Basically over time you'll be paying, for the same option, twice as much as you would have if you had held through earnings.\n\nThat is my only challenge to your analysis; if you're looking at shares, fine, you're right, but most people are looking for options here.Got $20 calls for april that are up about 100% and shares. Was just going to hold through earnings but now I'm considering selling the calls and holding the shares through. What do you guys think, maybe do that and buy the calls back after or just hold everything? I just feel like theres a chance they could have good guidance or maybe Cohen makes a move with earnings so I don't want to miss anything.I sold dec11 $20 covered calls for like $120/contract and used that money to buy 14/17c spreads for 12/18. Near zero risk imonah. I'm bullish on Q3 because the b&m retail sector in general was able to achieve positive EPS. There's the CARES act to count on too to boost EPS2 words- Ryan CohenNo, the market is forward looking. Even if earnings are rough, they are going to announce how many stocks they bought or a new initiative and the stock will boom!\n\nThey have to nail this or RC is going to dismantle the bird.Going into earnings with shares and iron condors. Ready for anything (including bagholding).I sold 6 $15puts expiring next week. Would love for a dip to get assignedNice analysis. Personally I think it will ride into earnings and sell of either at them or slightly before. Going to pick up a short term 1 day trade, dump and then pick up again after the inevitable fall for the long termIf earnings are bad, won't that just push the short squeeze that much harder?And bad earnings is priced in, no one gives af about sales unless they do better than expected. This is all about guidance and Dogman taking over or not. This ain't your normal earnings retard.I\u2019m agreeing with you on this. I think the dip will get bought up pretty quick before it is too significant though.\n\nI\u2019m too afraid something unexpected will come up and push it up so I\u2019m holding longer calls and selling short term for the premium.[deleted]If one feels this way, sell covered calls and *do not* sell shares.  This is not something you want to time the market on.  You will be wrong and it will be to your detriment.Why not just buy some puts on Monday to protect downside and if it doesn't tank sell the puts on Wednesday?If q3 will be bad Cohen will swing his dick so hard even CEO will ask him to step in and end his sad life. If earnings will be good, stock will rocket harder than NIO when it was actually good meme stockNo way I get out of my position to avoid a bad reaction to earnings. That's how you miss the squeeze. If anything it would just be a good incentive to buy more. Maybe hedge with some cheap weekly puts.I\u2019ll be trimming some of my calls right before earnings to lock in gains but selling shares is not the move at allGme is a garbage company and a dumpster fire.... \n\nThe short interest and possibly of a short squeeze is appealing as well. \n\nBut I will not  buy it until the squeeze starts happening. If it gets over 20 I will start buying and use buy at market orders to help the squeeze. \n\nAfter earnings if it gets over 20 I'm in. But I dont think the numbers are going to be good with pandemic etc.... \n\nIt's a wait and see game...I think you make a reasonable, data driven point about the same store sales. \n\nIf we left out all the incremental initiatives/items (rollout of nascent digital advertising, clarification of the MSFT partnership impact [Melvin is known to have called it a \u201cnothing burger\u201d and don\u2019t buy the lifetime rev share value as being material], any quantification of the blowout November performance & affirmation of market share leading allocations, etc.) then I\u2019d agree.  \n\nNo one fucking knows what\u2019s going to happen, it very well may dip, especially if (when?) the big shorts decide to get aggro and try controlling a negative narrative. \n\nI suspect that any post ER dip gets bought hard.\n\nPositions: 9000 shares, more than 100 $10C from Apr21 to Jan22, and nearly that many deep OTM LEAPSI keep saying this; I don't know why people suddenly think because they are planning to transition to an online store, they're going to go up from earnings. I am not even sure GME is the largest sale of this console generation either. All my local EB games got 4-5 consoles. Walmart, bestbuy and other places here were SELLING the console online release day still lol. EB games online wasn't selling any consoles 6 hours after it was on the website for preorders.\n\nPlus, people seem to forget earnings almost always causes a dip. Even when they post slightly above expectations.1. Timing the market is typically not a good call. \n \n2. Totally not suspicious that a several year old account with one other post (about a sitcom) is telling us all not to buy in.i agree with your assessment about q3 reports....but this has to be all about q4 and the future. what they plan on doing with the increase of holiday lockdowns and how they plan on capitalizing.I'm surprised you didn't mention the squeezeThis CC gonna be more hyped than SBAgreed.

Too retarded to fully understand options so I\u2019m looking at shares. I have a RH deposit clearing on the 7th, are you suggesting to wait until after earnings report to buy?Shitty earnings are expected and priced in. If they  perform only slightly shitty they may get a pump.What about buying some puts to hedge shares into earnings. Then of it drops you can buy more and avg down and if it goes up u take a small loss and still in the big shares playYou son of a bitch I\u2019m inIf you own shares in this thing. I think the risk of potentially missing a news headline or an earnings surprise is too great. I got burned trying to do what you recommend. I had north of 3k shares and sold 400, 2 hours later Microsoft signed a revenue sharing agreement and GameStop was halted for trading. Then it shot up 50%. I\u2019m holding through at least the March earnings report. Keep in mind also, they are buying 63% of their short term debt early, 3 days after earnings...things can\u2019t be that bad if their cash flow is being used this way.2019Q1,2019Q2, 2019Q3, 2020Q2 CC data under reported sales.... Also have we baked in currency tailwinds from the dollar's vast underperfomance? I think we will be around 1bil in rev but positive EPS. There is your surprise.Ok so what\u2019s to like about this stock. As an outsider looking in, it just looks like an outdated business model with a management team that isn\u2019t making any changes. Please help me understand the hypeTo be frank eb games / GameStop has always been the last place on my mind as a gamer .. hate the store ... hate the people working there . There sales suck .. trade in values suck \n\nPeople buy games digitally right off the damn store on Xbox and PlayStation of steam bypassing these goofs altogether \n\nSelling a game console is at cost for them ... brand new games are profits or cents or a dollar I believe ...\n\nWhy is this place going up ?Illuminati confirmed if they beat their fucking ER when did PS5 start selling?Oh Look, we got a Alpha paperhand over hear. Go dumb ur shares with ur weak ass paperhands. Stupid boiWe see you SUS from Melvin Capital!yea for goodness sake, don\u2019t try to time the market.\n\nno one knows how it will go after earnings. Expectations are already shitty. No one expects anything good from Q3. Even if it does drop, it will recover quickly simply because of the many bull factors.\n\nEarnings is just a small factor. Guidance, new strategic initiatives, developments are equally or even more important.\n\nEdit: If you are really scared, sell covered calls because if price rockets, at least you secure some gains. If it does drop, at least you have some hedge. If you sell your shares, it\u2019s just... unwise. If you are willing to sacrifice a huge potential gain for a tiny loss then you might as well invest in ETFs...\n\nLike OP said, GME is going up in the long run. With a short squeeze, does it matter whether you entered at 14,15,16,17 or even 20s?Haha! Just sharing my personal thoughts/analysis :)Thanks for your thoughts. I agree, long term this is going up. My commentary was just trying to shed some light on my short term perspective.I don't think maybe people have actually [read the letter](https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/RC%20Ventures%20Letter%20to%20GameStop.pdf). This is some HEAT they have to respond to, and it better be good.Interesting perspective - congrats to you for being smart enough to get in on this last year! I agree that for the longer term, Q3 is meaningless, but I do think the market will react to any miss vs. the latest consensus numbers.i though iv falls after earnings report. can you expand on why you think iv will rise instead? thanks man.Thanks for the perspective u/Everyman_B. You raise a good point - I can't comment on option strategy here as that is not my forte. This analysis was targeted at current/future share holders.I wouldn't sell either. April calls won't be affected as much by IV or negative news.  I have a feeling after Earnings IV may increase and those same call may be the same price at a lower share price because of that.A split/hedged risk sounds reasonable.\n\nYou never know what else they might still announce, apart from the un-interesting Q3 results.Nice. Yeah, I\u2019m too in the business of collecting premium, last position - sold $21 12/11 calls for about $110 and bought some cheap-ass puts to hedge against earnings.Thanks for the perspective. To be fair, a lot of the B&M players were able to generate positive comps through COVID which will not be the case here. That being said, the CARES act could be an interesting dynamic.He is certainly a catalyst for this stock!They will have bought zero shares. Stop spreading this misinformation. Management clearly said they aren\u2019t buying back sharesYeah. Either way, it can go only upwards.\n\nActually, the chances of screwing up seem rather low.>, the market is forward looking. Even if earnings are rough, they are going to announce how many stocks they bought or a new initiative and the stock will boom!\n\nI agree with you that the market is forward looking. However, that assumes that they have forward-looking data which we may or may not have (i.e. depends on whether management discloses this information).Best of luck. Definitely important to have big cajones for this play!Interesting strategy. Thanks for sharingAppreciate it! Short term risk hedging could be a good way to play this as well. Best of luck.I don\u2019t think that bad earnings (on its own) would be the catalyst. Perhaps, this would prompt RC Ventures and Cohen to react, but this is a different issue.>selling short term for the premium.\n\nCool - best of luck!Yep - credit card data includes both online and in-store sales. Obviously, the data is imperfect, but it is good proxy given lack of data.I agree selling CCs is wiser than selling shares. However, if you're selling CCs when the squeeze could happen at any time, aren't you essentially trying to time the market that the squeeze won't happen during your CC selling? You'll miss out on gains if the squeeze happens and you have to sell your shares for way cheaperSmart. 20 seems like a good entry and might indicate the beginning of the squeeze. See you there fam!I whole heartedly agree that Q3 numbers are insignificant longer term (which is why I am still long). However, at the end of the day, Wall Street is Wall Street and they care about earnings beats/misses.I think the squeeze has been mentioned enough for one day! That is definitely a plus but it could be weeks / months / years. I definitely can't predict that one haha!Haha glad this was helpful! Per the above, consider getting in AFTER earnings on 12/8. You might be able to get a more attractive price :)Thanks for the comment. I would point you to several of the posts already made on this subreddit in the last week or so (can just google $GME). They have done a great job outlining the bull case here. That being said, you would need to have a much higher risk threshold here to make money given the large swings, so it's definitely not for everyone :)Short squeezeIt is an outdated business model as is. Hype will come from them actively making moves to conform to the current digital age and making improvements. There are a number of catalysts that can basically set off a rapid market buy, thus the hypothetical squeeze people are talking about. They paid off a significant amount of debt recently. There's also the new console cycle with the PS and Xbox. I don't know what GME will be in five years, but I do believe that this is a solid money maker in the very near term.>I play video games a lot and made stupid trade ins as a kid so now I know the fair value of this company\n\nIt's going up because the share price didn't / doesn't maybe reflect the value of the company.Guidance will be good.Sold $18 covered call for this week and sold $20 for next week. Its a good bonus for sharesWhen did the market ever move based on the quarterly report? Its all about the guidance bro. Go back to your mamaYou brought up some excellent points, though if someone were intent on selling out and getting back in I might recommend selling covered calls that net a ton due to the high IV. To hedge against missing out on a possible spike right after earnings, you could buy calls a few strikes above the ones you sold.Sharing your short term view while still holding the shares. GTFO dude, stop being a pussy and walk the talk.IV doesn't always fall after events. It's less an explanation and more of an observation; IV movement can actually increase or decrease at any time, most stocks aren't interesting plays of course which is why the IV falls so hard but for those that are IV can sustain or even grow. GME earnings is *not* the event sought so IV may not react at all.Earnings won't predict short squeeze so the IV might not get cut in half immediately after earnings. Typically earnings + guidance kills uncertainty/IV but does not make up for other black swans like a unpredictable short squeeze. Even if RC doesn't try a takeover or GME doesn't offer a buyback the squeeze might still happen. \n\nRKT had the same level of IV but immediately dropped 80-100% after earnings, you could have sold 2021 $40 calls for $10/contract and bought them back for $1-2/contract two weeks later (even at a sh price of 25-28), I sold shorter dated puts and calls and made decent return, enough to still sell my RKT shs at $21 for a profit. I'm a bit more cautious selling cc's for my GME shs this time but if they get called away I'll take my 30% gains and move on.Got it. Well, then it is a fine analysis for what it is.Rip to your puts, if they were cheap they were otm and iv crush will kill them!And he filed an intent to purchase with the SEC if management doesn\u2019t make the changes he suggested. Its going to be an interesting few weeks.Who knows what they will announce. Buybacks are one possibility, a major game changer is another. Either way, they have to nail it or the great white shark known as RC will eat them for lunch! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude0ePorshe wasn't buying Volkswagen. Until they did.Like selling covered calls? I was thinking about doing that with GME before earnings..[deleted]I\u2019m selling 3 covered calls for $22 Dec 11. Someone is paying me $300 in premiums for this.to a degree.  my #1 concern regarding this call....is hearing them say they can\u2019t forecast q4 because of supply constraints from sony and microsoft and nintendo for consoles. from what i tracked this year....every company that did this got spanked.Or you may be buying in at a higher price.  I have been buying every time it dips under $16.  Bought 100 shares today under $17.  MM were holding price down today so $17 calls expired worthless.  I think it would have been at $18 otherwise.\n\nI think GME may be like Nordstrom and pump because the news wasn't as bad as they expect plus debt payoff, plus any 2021/future plans.  They also still have $100M in stock buybacks that was already approved last year that they didn't use.What\u2019s the move long calls short calls or putsThank you. I\u2019ve been trying to look past these posts all week since it isn\u2019t PLTR but I\u2019ll have to do some DD this weekendThank you for the reply, what is the time frame that these catalyst are set to take place? It sounds like everybody is expecting earnings to be shit with good guidance into the future.\nDebt buy back is big, but have they announced anything as to what the plan is to digitalize?The company was closing stores left right and centre and pay stupid rent in dieing malls \n\nYou idiots realize that brand new ps5 is sold at cost for 499 ... these clowns don\u2019t make moneyIs guidance guaranteed? Other b&m retailers are not providing guidance in latest ER. Not sure why it would benefit mgmt to release now, during all this uncertainty.100% priced in.\n\nEdit: what isn\u2019t priced in is the Cohen taking over and their partnership with Sony digital sales on ps4 just wait for that catalystfuck thats good advice. just sold my first cc ever today on GME 20c 12/11. Never thought about buying a call incase it fuckin moons suddenlyInteresting strategy - thank you for sharing.I understand your sentiment but I think he\u2019s genuinely trying to help people find a better entrance price and he raises valid, very real pointsThe ER and following investor call is exactly why IV has spiked. It would take a big announcement to make the IV go even higher afterwards. We're already at 225%+I appreciate that :)Don\u2019t spread misinformationThis might be the dumbest post I have read. This is about a Company buying back their own shares - which they announce ahead of time.\n\nAnother gambler that doesn\u2019t even know the basics of what they are buyingPerhaps, but I am sure there are experts here who know more about hedging. For my part, I will be holding off on buying before earnings completely.better to sell puts in case it spikes on good guidance. calls could lose your sharesAbsolutely. I\u2019ll dig that up and share. It\u2019s worth noting that most of these services are paid services, but I can share screenshots to the extent that is helpful :)Right. And if (not likely, but IF) $GME rockets up to $30 before Dec. 11, then you just missed out on like $2,400 (300 shares x $8/per share appreciation).I also bought 101 shares for $16.81 each today. I can double the number of shares if the price drops a bit after earnings, but it's a guess at this point.I'd expect sometime between Q3 to Q4 earnings. Three month period, maybe. If Cohen doesn't like earnings, he has publicly implied* that he'll initiate a takeover, so that could be a catalyst. I'm sure anything they announce will be on Dec 8th. Anything can happen, so it's just sitting and waitingIf they don\u2019t provide guidance, shareholders will eat them alive. Especially after the whole Cohen ordeal.Yeah... you'll have to hope we don't gap up on Monday if you're wanting a call to protect your upside, or hope that we don't moon in general until you're out from under the $20c. Don't fomo, that's how people lose money. Theta gang is always a good play, though on a stock with moon potential like this you may want to modify your plays. \n\nSomething I did on RIOT was own ITM calls and sell call credit spreads, essentially making them covered call credit spreads. You're losing some premium compared to just the covered call, but you miss a minimal amount if we moon.No problem, feel free to ask questions.IV for GME has been this high for months. No one could possibly care about the earnings. To even say that is to not understand the GME situation. The short-squeeze definitely is not something regarding the earnings of GME.It's screaming... short me!Sorry I heard that on hereBut isn't the point to protect my position if it doesn't spike. How does selling puts do that?Yes. That\u2019s is the risk.  But your implying the stock might double in a week.Thank you, I\u2019ll do some DD this weekend!He never said anything of the sort. It is only implied in his letter.The investor call is where we expect the board to have to respond to RC since he sent it during the quiet period.No, that's just you after every GME commentI'm genuinely curious not being argumentative. I just started messing with covered calls and I dont think I grasp covered puts as clearly yet.. Reading up on it.It doesn't protect your existent position at all, I think he's trying to present it as an alternative to a buy-write.Still won't matter. Console cycle is where the money is. Cohen is ... well if Cohen didn't exist console cycle is where the money is anyway. Cohen is a weird variable.Short me!Selling a put when IV is high means you will collect the premium and possibly pick up more shares at a lower price. The premium you get when you sell it is your protection. And if it doesn't drop, you keep it anyway.Gotcha thanks for clearing that up. If I can ask one more question. So when you write a covered call you want it to match your shares. So 500 shares would mean 5 covered calls. Is it the same with selling puts or is the short position I'm opening independent of those shares?No, puts are secured with cash so if you sell a 15p you'd have $1500 used as collateral until the position is closed or you get assigned.Ah ok. Thanks again.",

    "selfText": "Greetings fellow autists. Y'all remember Marie Kondo? Japanese woman that gets off to cleaning people's shit up for them? Only keep things that spark joy? Fuck yeah. Well, with all you retards losing money by being balls long PLTR, I figured it was time to help you Marie Kondo your own portfolio. Let's tidy that shit up and spark some fucking Joyy.\n\nYes I spelled Joyy with two y's. And no big brain, that wasn't a typo. **Joyy ($YY) is your next one-way ticket to the goddamn moon.** Can you do basic math? Great. Neither can I. Do you get slightly aroused at the mere sight of a woman with a pulse? Of course you do. I myself just went six to midnight typing that out. Do you like losing money in the stonk market? Clearly. But I'm here to try to change that.\n\nCongrats on making it this far. Let's get started!\n\n$YY is the largest live-streaming platform you've never heard of. **It's like if TikTok merged with OnlyFans and was a publicly traded stonk**. I'll wait while you buy a few shares on that premise alone.\n\nBut it gets better. Much better. Joyy operates two live-streaming services, one is called YY Live and its getting sold to Baidu for $3.6bn. **The other is called Bigo Live and it's one of the top 10 apps in the world with revenues growing more than 130% y/y.** Many of the videos on Bigo are of hot Asian women live-streaming themselves dancing. Nice.\n\nThat's still not even the best part though. Galaxy brain question: would you rather pay full price for something or get something at a discount? What if you could get it for close to free? Well, at YY's current price, you're nearly getting Bigo Live for free. Please consult a doctor if you have an erection lasting for more than four hours.\n\nHow can that be? This part requires some remedial math skills that you and I both don't have, but alas, we must soldier on.\n\nYY currently has $2.8bn in net cash on their balance sheet. Woah! I didn't know this was a fucking advanced accounting class. Well it is. Stay with me. We also know YY is going to get $3.6bn in cash from Baidu for the sale of YY Live. Lastly, YY is an investor in a company called HUYA that is valued at $750mm.\n\nSo... $2.8bn plus $3.6bn plus $750mm is? No, not $420.69 you retard. Try again. It's $7.1bn. Feel free to sit down and drink a sip of water if your head is spinning from all these numbers.\n\nCompare this $7.1bn to YY's current market cap of $7.8bn. $7.8bn minus $7.1bn for everything that isn't Bigo Live is $600mm. There you have it. That's the implied value the market is giving to Bigo Live.\n\nHoly shit right? To quote the great David Byrne from Talking Heads: [you may ask yourself](https://youtu.be/5IsSpAOD6K8?t=69)...\n\n* Didn't Baidu just pay $3.6bn for YY Live?\n* And isn't Bigo Live growing 130%+ while YY Live is barely growing?\n* And aren't Bigo Live and YY Live about the same size at $1.8bn in revenues?\n* And finally \u2013 you may ask yourself \u2013 if Baidu is willing to pay $3.6bn for YY Live, shouldn't Bigo Live be valued way the fuck more than that?\n\n**The answer to all of these questions is fuck yes.** Bigo Live should be valued way higher than $600mm but you retards are too busy jacking off and losing money on PLTR to figure it out.\n\n**The other great part about YY is we get to fuck some bears on our way to the moon**. I cannot expressly condone nor condemn the actual fucking of bears, but I can condone the fucking of some short sellers. Muddy Waters just released a short report on Joyy and short sellers piled in like the dumbass lemmings they are. How did YY respond to the short report you may ask? **By giving MW the double middle finger and increasing their dividend by $200mm.** Do frauds usually do that? Hell no they don't.\n\nThat's how you fucking spark Joyy in your portfolio!",

Probably some pump and dump attemptYY will not have any direct exposure to China after the YY Live deal closes. They're headquartered in Singapore. Plus, why just take a picture of your dong after jerk off onto a hundo when you could livestream the whole thing?YY is headquartered in Singapore and their only direct exposure to China is through YY Live. After the sale to Baidu closes, they'll no longer have any direct exposure to Chinese regulations or risk from the potential delisting of Chinese stocks.Those lawsuits don't mean anything. I remember when hundreds of these lawsuits were coming after NIO back when their stock was in freefall mode. Just a bunch of salty boomers/karens that can't accept responsibility for choosing a shitty stock. Its quite pathetic actually since you never see any of us filing a lawsuit for our terrible decision making.Thought so. Thanks for confirming.We will have to see. I personally am bearish and believe the allegations. If the sale to Baidu completes AND the company is cleared of fraud, that would be the time to buy in.\n\nRight now YY is like Nikola with extreme up/down potential depending on how the fraud case plays out, and whether their partnership continues.Like Nikola is perhaps the most retarded comparison I've heard in at least an hour...good job.Exactly.

    "selfText": "Remark Holdings Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:\u00a0MARK) is flying in the market today, and it\u2019s nothing new. For several trading sessions, the stock has traded on either single, or double-digit gains.\nThe gains started when the company announced that it started shipping AI based thermal imaging technology to customers in the United States and Japan about two weeks ago. Recent evidence shows that one of these customers may be\u00a0Walmart Inc\u00a0(NYSE:\u00a0WMT), but there\u2019s much more to this than Walmart. [article](https://alphastocknews.com/remark-holdings-mark-stock-theres-more-to-it-than-walmart/3352/)\n\nDD done by \u201cInformed Observer\u201d\n\nMARK remains in default on $11.9MM of debt owed to MGG which delivered its notice of acceleration to the Company on March 16. The 30 day period to cure the default ends tomorrow. MARK is likely able to meet this obligation under the terms of its $30MM Common Stock Purchase Agreement with Aspire Capital Fund (signed April 9, 2020); however, it comes at the cost of additional dilution for shareholders, particularly in the context of MARK\u2019s intrinsic value.\n\nMARK is also in the process of resolving the risk that it is delisted from the NASDAQ for failure to maintain a $1.00 per share valuation for a ninety day period. The requirement for curing the notice of delisting is for MARK\u2019s shares to close above $1.00 per share for 10 consecutive trading days, before, by my estimate, the 22nd of May.\n\nThe resolution of these two controversies remove two important catalysts which have been central to the short seller thesis and is likely to contribute to short covering.\n\nThe Company still has to finish its 2019 audit and it is unclear to me; Covid notwithstanding, why this has taken so long since the sale of the Company\u2019s Vegas.com was completed in May 2019. The good news is that MARK\u2019s auditor has not resigned and the Company\u2019s past audits have been qualified with \u201cgoing concern\u201d risk language, so at this point the auditor\u2019s opinion letter can\u2019t get much worse\u2026.unless they refuse to provide an opinion\u2026which should already have been announced if it was going to happen.\n\nAs we get closer to MARK\u2019s restated Q4 and FY 2019 10-K filing and update call on Thursday, May 28\u2026.market focus will shift to the contents and substance of the Company\u2019s narrative regarding the status of its KanKan AI business with particular emphasis on names of clients and the size of contacts and the implications for twelve month revenues and cash flow. There has been a lot of speculation on these issues in the past three weeks, much of it informed by the Company\u2019s own tweets, which is a business practice that many appropriately believe hurts the organization\u2019s credibility.\n\nMARK management needs to be clear and precise on their call on the 28th about the status, size, and duration of contracts (even if NDAs prevent them from naming clients) and provide investors with 12 month revenue and margin guidance, Open-ended statements about the scope of the thermal imaging and AI opportunity (as they have done on past calls when talking about the China business) without reference to real contracts is insufficient given the Company\u2019s Twitter teases about Wynn, Simon Property Group, (Disney or was there a different source?) et al. The call needs to expand upon, not regurgitate, the substance of the Company\u2019s rare and effective official statement of April 30.\n\nIt is hard to know the number of outstanding MARK shares at the moment but reasonable to assume that it is markedly higher than the 55.1MM last reported on September 30, 2019. Nevertheless, the value of MARK\u2019s investment in ShareCare (which remains impaired by MarK\u2019s default on the MGG loan) has appreciated by more (based on the revaluation of the telehealth sector which is up 60-80% with the outbreak of Covid-19) than the increase in MARK\u2019s share count (which has a share cap of 20% under the Aspire Agreement).\n\nThe value of the ShareCare investment (once unencumbered by MGG\u2019s lien) likely supports a MARK share price that is 2-3X MARK\u2019s current share price. The value on the KanKan AI business and any contracts that the Company has secured in the last six months (or will secure in the next six months) is all incremental to the value of MARK. Uncertainties remain over the next several days; however, their resolution and the fact that MARK will own the narrative thereafter (and may actually announce contracts), creates an attractive set-up and demands attention.",

Its a form of security theatre. Business want them so they can make people feel safe but if government agencies aren't going to mandate them the demand of the thermal imaging technology is not going to substantially increase. Thermal Imaging does little to prevent COVID due to 80% of all people being asymptomatic of those who get infected.Still didn\u2019t age well hahayou sure about that lol?You\u2019re questioning if this will prevent the virus, a vaccine of some sort. That\u2019s not the purpose of thermal imaging or this company. A high percentage of Covid cases have fever like symptoms. I did not say all, but a high percentage. These thermal imaging devices can detect the body temperature within .3 percent. Facts matter, so I\u2019ll have to edit this comment with the links I read yesterday. So if big stores can preach safety to the public by being able to detect high body temperature before entering their stores, I\u2019m assuming that is a step towards preventing spread.

Especially options. But ignoring options for a little bit, I wanna focus on web development.\n\nThere are two kinds of autists; you guys, and the kind [who can actually make money.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-21/goldman-plans-hiring-spree-in-trading-only-coders-need-apply) A lot of the folks in that second camp have been spending the last 10+ years making web development easy and accessible so even retards like you and I can #LearnToCode. Doing this is important for a bunch of reasons - for example, if the internet of things is going to become a reality, it can't take years of development and a team of researchers for a company to build a connected toothbrush. \n\nIn other words, apps are going to become almost like commodities - in the sense that they will be cheap, fungible, and easily produced. And there won't be any shortage of people capable of doing that production - especially when you factor in educated workers from emerging markets. \n\nI think Alphabet has stayed ahead of the curve by positioning itself at the center of a lot of the otherwise open-source dev projects, whereas Amazon has it AWS. Companies like Snapchat and Uber, on the other hand, are billion-dollar commodities.",

If all it took to build the next facebook was coding it a lot more people would be trying.Op doesn\u2019t realize that the software piece is the easiest, getting the users is always the hardest.Great, so all you need to do is accurately predict when the next market crash will be.\n\nGo ahead.K boys let\u2019s clone a fake Uber repo and instantly make billions!Uber is lame afThe money is in the platform, not the app itself dipshitIt\u2019s all about the advertising dollars and having warm bodies viewing them. \n\nI saw a Trump 2020 ad on Snapchat last week, the 2020 election is going to be huge for social media platforms as political campaigns pour money to capture  new Gen Z voters.You zip it sparky, SPY or die, the rest are just icing on the cakeMy uber position is getting rekktAs a mid-level developer, I can tell you that the dropout rate for developers is massive. Even those that finish school or training programs are still in an uphill battle because nobody wants to hire a novice developer, that's more work than not hiring one at all. This causes many more new developers to get dropped off during the job search phase.\n\nDevelopers aren't in high demand due to a lack of people trying, it's due to a lack of talent because the early learning curve is steep and landing a job is rough.\n\nSoftware also has to be maintained and updated. It will never become worthless or \"cheap commodities\". The only exception are simple mobile games that get spit out like no other and never get touched again.Google will be fucked eventuallyI remember when Google tried to make Google+ the new Facebook. I'm pretty sure they relaunched that a few times too.I like you, you are all right with me SpermInvestor.(Serious tho)Exactly what I was thinking. The sw itself is largely a commodity (yes there are innovations in UI and UX) but the platform, reach and network effect is  why those mentioned companies are worth billions. Facebook and other consumer products would be worthless if there were no usersAnd MySpace was very popular ... right up until the point it wasn't. And how much did Tumblr recently sell for? I'm sure it still has a pretty big userbase. And if it doesn't, that still works in my favor. And how does the network effect apply to Uber?\n\nI'm not smart, I'm just not as much as a retard as you are - which is really my point here. That DURING A CRASH - i.e. when everything is going down - you wouldn't want to be the guy holding a company like Uber.I get that - but stocks are meant to be 10+ year investments. Putting your money in something easily replaceable/upgradable for 10 years is risky.\n\nWhen people are looking for overly risky assets to dump (i.e. in a panic during a crash) I just think Uber and Snap will and should be high up on the listSent from UberPoolwhat else is there if i wanna go somewhere from my house, a fkin cab service that comes 40 min later??Honestly I think now's a good time to buy SNAP. Tripled in value recently, and there's still a lot of room to grow. If next years earnings are positive (which they should be) because the platform is growing. Yeah Snapchat has a growing userbase, mainly due to its popularity with people 11 > 21. Snapchat is worth roughly $15.9 a share. I think that could increase to $25 > $35 within two years, if the predicted recession doesn't happen in that time.\n\nAlso, even if a recession DOES HIT. Snapchat is a free service. Unless 20 million people suddenly decide they can't afford a cheap android smartphone, even if they can't afford a new IPhone, Snapchat won't be hit as hard as other companies, that provide luxury services. I'd probably buy even more SNAP stock if a recession hit. Double your profits when the world comes out the other side.Soxl/FNGU or die*\n\nYolo like a manHowIt\u2019s a network effect because more clients attract more drivers, attract more clients,etc. The larger the user/driver base the better the value proposal for everyone on the platform hence a network effect.\n\nPretty sure I\u2019m wasting my time explaining this to you though because your clearly a 15 years old trying to act like he knows shit.\n\nThe case agaisnt uber in a recession is clearly more the fact that it could be deemed a luxury good which would be the first expense people would cut in a recession. Not that the software is easily replicable.Why amazon?  AWS hosts some of the largest company\u2019s data and compute in the world.\n\nI just think you should be aware that in the olden days (90s) if your company could build it, it would be a success \u2014 mostly because people had good ideas but no one was sure if it was possible to actually build the hardware.  Now that most things are software they can almost always be built, but the question now is if anyone will want to buy or use it.  \n\nApps are already fairly easy to build, spend a couple grand to a few million and you can hire teams to do it fairly reliably.FDs don't last 10 years.     \n     \nYou're doing it wrong, bb.Yes, that\u2019s the drawback and largest risk of consumer companies, missing the trend ie AOL, Yahoo, MySpace.

Currently, there's Uber and Lyft, and all their drivers drive for both. Soon, there will be a few dozen others, and we'll have TSLA and Waymo cars driving us around. As more drivers drive for more and more tech companies making riding apps, the less Uber and Lyft make. When anyone gets self driving to work, there will be as many cars as that company and it's VC backing can afford. Then we'll have the scooter situation... My metro started with one scooter and one bike company; now there are seven companies renting scooters and five renting bikes. Our streets are littered with them. And I really those bitches off every curb I see. It's awesome.Ah the good old days.85% of their revenues comes from ads. Banner ads are already getting destroyed by Adblock browsers like brave. \n\nI see the web moving towards privacy by default in the future. Which leaves their ad revenue model in troubleI think its a bit more nuanced. Uber and Lyft are the main two, Juno is kinda in NYC but not really. If you wanted to start another driver network it would fail b/c 1 the space is full and 2 the model isn't profitable with human drivers. In the begging you can cobble together an app and enter the market but I don't think this is the main stopping point for ppl with millions to invest in a company.Ad blockers don't exist on mobile, and the vast majority of web browsing is moving to mobile. Also, in a more privacy-focused future, their ads would be less targeted, not less prevalent.     \n     \nLook at stats on ad blockers to see how dumb you are, ya pathetic downvoter. Lol.That's fair. But, others will follow Juno in select areas, and there are (supposedly) driverless options coming.   \n     \nE: it'd also make sense for F and GM and other auto manufacturers to get in on this game. I could see discounted cars for their exclusive drivers or something. Idk.Ad blockers don\u2019t exist on mobile?Ad blockers do exist on mobile browsers... I use one nowyou are right googles ads would be less targeted. Which means less effective as an advertisement tool. If users flock to a privacy by default browsers like brave they can grow out their own ad system they are developing now. Googles ads have become spywareish with trackers/malware whereas braves aim to show you targeted ads but it lets the browser decide on the targeting without spilling your data over the network to publishers, advertisers or Brave itself. It gauges your interest chiefly by the content of websites you visit while browsing. \n\nThere\u2019s also a machine learning aspect to the browser that measures your engagement with the ad and pays you for your attention. \n\nI\u2019ve been using the browser on mobile and desktop solely for its speed and adblocking capabilities. I haven\u2019t seen an ad on YouTube or even pornhub for a whileI don't think others will hop in since drivers are not sustainable and creating a network now would be a big marketing push. Could maybe make something work but I doubt the juice is worth the squeeze. Would have to find some niche to stand out. Uber/Lyft are reliable, Juno supposedly shares profit betterSorry, ad blockers suck on mobile, and are used much less frequently, especially on iPhone.On some browsers, but they're not as good and used much less frequently, especially on iPhone.Lol. Fuck Brave and their shitty shakedown-style business tactics. Also, fuck them fom breaking websites by randomly selecting what JavaScript gets blocked -- like Pornhub's pagination buttons or YouTube's follow-up video recommendations. I want that shit to work, and Brave fails in that respect.        \n     \nLastly, you clearly have no idea how Google Ads works. They don't share any of their user's personal info with their advertisers. You're either shilling for Brave, lying for kicks, or just plain ignorant.That's just it, tho. Drivers sustain better with more apps. That's why they all drive for both Uber and Lyft. If there's a third or fourth option, the drivers also see the benefits of their marketing efforts. But, yeah, too many variables and way too much lucky timing required for me. I'm going to stick to randomly guessing if presidential tweets are going to blast my ass with uppies or blast my ass with downies. Cheers.Lol I\u2019m not shilling anything. I don\u2019t own any BAT. Just enjoy their product and saying eventually googles market dominance won\u2019t be as prevalentSo..... brave just caught google using hidden web pages to give user data to advertisers.... so fuck google and their intrusive practices. I\u2019ll take the occasional broken web sitehttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.techspot.com/amp/news/81746-brave-browser-team-google-using-hidden-pages-circumvent.htmlI believe that...which makes you lying for kicks or just ignorant \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af I'm usually the latter. Cheers.I call bullshit. Provide a legit source if you're going to make that level of outlandish crap.     \n      \nE: also, if you're talking about [this](https://www.techspot.com/news/81746-brave-browser-team-google-using-hidden-pages-circumvent.html), you're an idiot with shit reading comprehension and critical thinking skills. Lol.You must've missed my edit. That's the exact same link that I said you'd be an idiot to cite. Lmfao.    \n     \nThat accusation was made a year ago, and the \"hidden\" pages they \"found\" don't support their argument.     \n      \nBrave often levels such accusations in an attempt to gain traction and obfuscate what's actually happening. They lie to confuse idiots into using their shitty browser so that they can then push their own advertising. It's as scummy as business models get, and sooner or later someone's going to sue them into oblivion for it.     \n    \nIf you want to not lose money, I suggest you carefully consider [Google's response](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/brave-google-push-pages-violate-gdpr-privacy,40330.html) and ask yourself why the stock jumped for the last couple days despite Brave's releasing this \"evidence\" (lol) three days ago.

He\u2019s the only the 3rd CEO and 1st outsider in the company\u2019s history who\u2019s very optimistic about a turnaround\n\n- they\u2019ve sold non-core assets and expect to raise additional $350mm-$450mm in cash from non-core that will be pushed towards digital sales\n\n- Digital Comps up 94% YoY. Penetration online continues to grow drastically with a 31% annual growth rate\n\n- More digital means wider margins. Gross Margins increased from 32.2% to 35.4% which simply means they make 3% more on every sale which is huge. \n\n- They\u2019ve increased the planned share buy-back from $675mm to $825mm in the next 3 years. That\u2019s 1/3 of the fucking float which signals the confidence of the management \n\n- Haters might point Net income was negative. True, but it was mainly due to $2.469 billion NON recurring  restructuring cost. If we omit that cost, the net income over the past three years is +$500mm. \n\n- EV/EBITDA is 10.01 vs conservative 12.7 industry average at the time of this post. So that alone should put us at a fair value of $35/share today. Based on forward EBITDA for 2021, that\u2019s $39/share in the next 12 months.

But seriously, I\u2019d at least pick a long dated expiry date like in MayI\u2019m fine with you losing like this, it takes a certain amount of people to torch their money in order to have an options market like we do.

It can go either way. \n\nTesla car owners aren\u2019t the people getting laid off (at least, not entirely).  These people can never afford an $80k car anyways. Even a $40k car is entry luxury level. \n\nThe owners are the programmers working from home. Or the senior management that can work from home, and will jump to another company, if they lose their job. Or the small business owners that can mint cash, once this crisis is over.\n\nAlso, because of Tesla\u2019s online ordering, then you don\u2019t need to visit a dealership. \n\nAnd since it\u2019s electric, it has less need for maintenance, so you don\u2019t need to visit a mechanic.

The weekly chart doesn't show enough information to see the trap form.\n\nYou need to let the bull trap form first. Looking at the amzn chart on the DAILY, it looks more like a bullish pattern ready to break out.\n\nAlso it's fucking Amazon man. Literally the biggest bull. \n\nWith that said.. I believe Amazon will go down in the long term this year, but that's purely speculation not based in TA.\n\nGood luck[deleted]Pls GE bull trap too...Delet this famThis lying cunt jus tryin\u2019 to buy calls on the cheap.\n\n@Bitch-ass OP: nice try but you suck at being convincing worse than your moms sucking my asshole post-shit, no-wipe, thai-hot Pad Thai diet.\n\nMods, ban this bitch OP for dishonoring us with such a *lousy* attempt at shilling bs.

If nothing happens, then the vix drops and stocks pop. If a deal is made then stocks RIP till 2019 Feb.I hear you. I bought most of my AMZN shares in 2014 - between $300 and $350. I usually make $2k a month selling calls \u2014 but every now and then I get assigned and have to rebuy. Still thinking might stay under 1695 until next weekBest call *is* a call.

I\u2019m biased because it\u2019s gone up 1650+ twice this month.\n\nSo it makes no sense.thought so.  that means you don't believe in your own lil TA chart. your 'position' is not having a position, meaning you are not confident enough in your own 'research' to short AMZN. you're telling us AMZN is a bull trap, i.e. it's about to crash down again. yet... you dont actually believe this very strongly, because you dont have a short position. \n\n> I'm net short by holding cash\n\nYou are adorableSo you are poor and since you don\u2019t have skin in the game you are just guessing.

Other helpful info or pointing out mistakes in my DD is very welcome.\n\nFears preventing you from buying PLTR\n\n1. Targeted ads on your phone from Yahoo Finance or Zacks telling you PLTR = BAD!!!1!eleven\n2. Shills spamming \"pLtR tO tHe MoOn\" and :rocket: on PLTR thread comments.\n3. Last quarter's seemingly bad financials/earnings.\n4. Financials Moving Forwards\n5. Soros who owns 21 million shares \"threatening\" to sell his shares upon DPO expiry.\n6. DPO expiry 3 days after February's earnings and possible insiders and DPO holders sale and dip.\n7. What does PLTR tldr.\n8. Other Information\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***#1 Targeted Ads***\n\nAds and articles are both paid for by someone.The fact that in the past 3 weeks i've been getting multiple multiple targeted ads on my phone related to PLTR since i love PLTR so much.\n\nAds are telling me that PLTR is bad, doesn't provide a dividend, they're telling me PLTR's fair price is 20 instead of 25 based on some financial model and have gone as far as to provide a list of alternative stocks to buy.\n\nTo me, this all screams: **SCARE TACTICS**\n\nAdditionally, the last few weeks of ups and downs in PLTR's stock price is another indication of the attempts to short the stock to sh!t and drive investors out. (For what reason? I don't know.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***#2 Shilling PLTR***\n\nI myself love to shill PLTR to people whenever i can. I do this because i legitimately think this company will do great. I work as a product manager in a software development house and understand what PLTR does. PLTR is not cryptic.Regardless, i think when people shill PLTR to you, they are right to do so as you're probably missing out on a great opportunity to make money in the long run. If you're looking for big gains short term, maybe try something else.\n\nShillery is OK, but at least give the facts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***#3 Last Quarter's Bad Financials***\n\nIf you'd done your DD not by searching reddit posts but by checking PLTR's actual quarterly report, you'd know that PLTR's \"bad\" last financial quarter/earnings were due to the costs of listing themselves on the *New York Stock Exchange*.\\~855million were spent on listing and stock related compensations and this is the big reason.\n\n**Direct quote by PLTR here:** [https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx)\n\n>We incurred a loss from operations of $847.8 million, which includes $847.0 million in stock-based compensation following our recent direct listing.\n\nI would like to remind everyone that this is a **1 TIME THING.** Put simply, this means that PLTR won't have as excessive losses next quarter as they did this last quarter.\n\n*Additionally*, let me go into further detail on this and not just leave it to that.\n\n* ***PLTR's quarterly operating expenses for the past 3 quarters were at around \\~260 million.***\n* ***PLTR's operating expenses this quarter were \\~987 million.***\n\nADDITIONALLY...\n\nPLTR also had a higher R&D cost this quarter that just passed. Normally they'd pay 80 million on R&D, but somehow ended up paying \\~300 million this quarter. No one knows why, but this is another thing that influenced PLTR's earnings.\n\n[https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx)\n\n>On September 30, 2020, in connection with the Direct Listing, we incurred $769.5 million and $8.4 million of stock-based compensation using the accelerated attribution method related to the satisfaction of the performance-based vesting condition for RSUs and growth units, respectively, that had satisfied the service-based vesting condition as of such date.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***#4 PLTR financials moving forwards***\n\nPLTR is deep in bed with the government and the Biden regime although may look like it would be against using PLTR is in fact secretly very pro-surveillance e.g pro Palantir.\n\nHere's some of the known organizations in the US Govt that use PLTR:\n\n1. CDC\n2. Office of the Secretary\n3. Food and Drug Administration\n4. Immigration and Customs Enforcements / ICE\n5. Internal Revenue Service / IRS\n6. National Institute on Drug Abuse\n7. DOD/ARMY - ACC Aberdeen Proving Ground\n8. Coast Guard / DHS\n9. DOD/NAVY - Naval Information Warfare Systems Command\n10. US Attorney's Offices / DOJ\n11. US Special Operations Command / SPEC OPS\n\nBoys. The big institutional people know these things. You just found this out. See how deep PLTR is already in bed with the Government?????? Palantir IS the next Raytheon/Lockheed of DATA aggregation and visualization.\n\n***UPCOMING EARNINGS***\n\nI've done some quick maths and it looks like PLTR is more likely to be in positive earnings this quarter and with a 0.02 cent EPS target, we can easily assume that they'll destroy this with maybe 0.04 or 0.08 EPS. In the worst case scenario, PLTR's EPS this quarter could be somewhere around MINUS -0.05 ish due to interview costs and ad/campaigning costs that were not there before the company was listed.\n\n***WHAT CAN DESTROY PALANTIR***\n\nNow, there's big possible downsides and Palantir can fail IF contracts that expire are not renewed. That's biggest REAL reason for Palantir's balance sheet getting screwed.\n\nI've seen a disturbing pattern with PLTR's financials and that's that every year, it's R&D cost is rising by between 150 and 350 million dollars. This is quite a bit of negative revenue and if new contracts are not constantly coming in, PLTR's balance can start going into the negative.\n\n***WHAT WILL NOT DESTROY PALANTIR***\n\nSome people may have concerns over the new left leaning government dumping PLTR. An article was posted that is behind a paywall EVERYWHERE that goes something like this:\n\n[https://www.thedailybeast.com/cdc-officials-urge-biden-team-to-dump-palantirs-covid-tracker](https://www.thedailybeast.com/cdc-officials-urge-biden-team-to-dump-palantirs-covid-tracker)\n\nIn my opinion, i believe this is inconsequential and that a few people crying to daddy Biden to kill a multimillion contract with PLTR is a stretch. Also we know the current new Biden team has his hands full and will have them full for at least the next 1 year with what's going on.\n\nThere is no time to deal with a few crybabies and even if he did deal with it and did decide to kill the PLTR Tiberius Covid tracker contract with the CDC which he WONT, these things take months and years to deal with, and by then the contract/s will have already brought PLTR tons of money and revenue in.\n\n***HOW MUCH DOES KARP AND HIS GOONS GET PAID***\n\nShort answer is... A LOT. The amounts below are PER YEAR. That's a lot of money in the hole and contributes to annoying amount to why PLTR is always just at the edge of just barely being profitable.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ba58nqcurob61.png?width=2615&format=png&auto=webp&s=55d45833faad4d60ea8dc142a9601c44b4cc7395\n\nPalantir's prospectus 311 page document's 130 last pages are almost all exclusively talking about extremely complicated options trading schemes that are made by Cohen and others to make sure they can squeeze out a LOT of money out of PLTR.\n\nMithril Investments has existed from before and is not a new company. Owned by Thiel/Cohen/Karp as a way to launder and exchange options for more options and more money for all 3 of them. Also Shyam Sankar to me feels corrupt which scares me a bit, he's had some very shady dealings and has brought his wife in PLTR that gets paid 200k per year.\n\nProspectus Document: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm)\n\nI suggest you skim through it, it contains EVERYTHING about Palantir.\n\n**Palantir is going to need to have to be getting AT LEAST 500 million in NEW contracts per year to REMAIN BARELY profitable. It's doable in my opinion, but just barely and it's why they made the company public to try and get more people's attention and increase the inflow of contracts.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***#5 Soros and his 21 million shares***\n\nFirst of all, i think we can all agree that Soros can suck it.\n\nIf you've read a few articles here and there, you'll know that Soros owns/owned 1% of Class A PLTR shares. No one knows whether he's sold them yet or if he's an DPO holder who'll sell 3 days after February's earnings.\n\nWhether he sells them or buys more will be mostly inconsequential in my opinion. We see dips and pumps every day. He legally cannot sell his shares all at once, he'll have to sell certain amounts daily and over time. This will create annoying sideways motion as shares exchange hands and consolidation starts for 2-3 weeks until his and insider shares exchange hands.\n\nNothing special to see here, move along just a little draw down resulting in some consolidation.\n\nPLTR is exposed to OIL more than anything, so fluctuations in the general market and general market crashes affect PLTR much less than other stocks. Also PLTR does not track ANY benchmarks. NONE.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***#6 DPO expiry 3 days after earnings in February***\n\nTo my limited knowledge, this is how BIG plays who are holding DPO shares usually work:\n\n* If a stock has performed well up to earnings and investors are more than happy with the returns, they're more likely to not sell their stock or just sell less than they normally would.\n* If a stock hasn't performed as well as investors thought, these investors are more likely to sell stock or reduce their positions more than normal.\n\nThere's a total of 1.16Billion Class A PLTR shares currently (Give or take don't flog me). We are currently trading with \\~250 million shares while the rest are locked away in the DPO.\n\nWhen those shares are \"unlocked\" in February, the price of the stock won't be diluted. These shares already exist and are accounted for. They are simply locked. Also when they are unlocked, the share price won't simply multiply because all shares are now tradeable.\n\n>According to [Palantir\u2019s after-hours filing with the SEC this afternoon](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520257973/d89036dex991.htm), the company has 1.16 billion Class A shares, 484 million Class B shares and 1 million Class F shares on its cap table outstanding today, or a total of roughly 1.64 billion. Only Class A shares will trade, and Class B and F shares are convertible to Class A shares on a one-to-one basis. On a fully diluted basis, which Palantir says represents 2.2 billion shares total according to its most recent S-1 filing, the company is valued at $16 billion. The difference between those two aggregate numbers comes from outstanding stock performance grants, warrants and other financial instruments.\n\nWhat **WILL** affect stock price:\n\n* Employees exercising their non class A options into Class A shares. This IS dilution.\n* The bigwigs e.g Alex Karp, Peter Thiel and a few other bigshots exercising their options and then selling them for a profit.\n\n*To note, regular employees will barely affect the price of the stock with their miniscule share holdings. Alex Karp, Peter Thiel and a handful of other high ranked executives in PLTR are the ones that will create a tiny but manageable ripple in the stock price.*\n\nWhat **COULD** affect the stock price a lot:\n\n* Massive sell off by the big institutional holders.\n* Not shorters. (Citron and Citi can suck it, we're in control here)\n* People with weak spaghetti wet paper hands.\n* Everyone fomoing the same weeklies e.g like when everyone bought Jan 15 calls on everything.\n* Big but silent scare campaign (that's already going on) to scare off normies like us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***#7 What does PLTR do, tldr.***\n\nImagine Facebook's database of everything about everyone & Youtube's Database of everything & Geolocation data in a database made by the US Army for known terrorist cells.\n\nPalantir allows you to select and match varied data TYPES from several different database, combine it in any way you want and visualize it so that it's human readable by even the dumbest person in the room so that even they can see patterns and come to conclusion on a subject matter.\n\nIt's kind of like filling an excel sheet with data and then visualizing it with a bar chart, except the date you filled the sheet with can be anything and not just numbers or dates or countries and you can make various combinations using all the different rows of data to maybe come up with a pattern to something like how to best distribute the Covid vaccines in the counties in a very specific state in the US.\n\nLiterally what you see in SciFi movies where people combine random data by smashing keys on a keyboard and somehow find the murderer, the location of a terrorist or the percentage that someone will commit a murder in the future based on a lot of random data about that person or the area, country, family, history... anything.\n\nWhile this all might sound super cool and amazing, it is. Maybe in 10 years time there will be a few more companies doing this, but for now, it's only Palantir, Circles, Alteryx and a few other private entities that do this type of thing. Many of them work with governments and are hush hush due to the kinds of things they use this type of software for (terrorist cells, warzones, etc) and the public backlash this could cause.\n\ntldr: Glorified data aggregator and visualization platform/software with different access levels for different people.\n\n**PLTR is superbly positioned to offer their software to SLOW and Boomer like organizations like Governments.**\n\nGovernments are stupid and don't have neither the time, nor technical knowledge to develop this software themselves for internal use. This is what PLTR capitalizes on and why Governments use them so much.\n\nGovernments could have spent the a fraction of the money they spend on PLTR contracts to make the software themselves but only for their own internal systems and use, but they can't and if they tried, they'd fail because technocracy in governments is not a thing. By the time they'd even complete a project like this, it'd likely be out of spec, unusable and would require further development and money and we know how slow and bad governments are at doing even the basics. Again PLTR wins because of this.\n\n**PLTR is likely NOT** to be adopted by giants like Google or FB or other modern tech organizations of any size because they are not stupid. They have their own purpose built internal systems that they use to do everything related to data aggregation and visualization because they have the technical knowledge and resources. Buying PLTR for their use is a joke.\n\nPLTR capitalizes on being general a general purpose tool and is set up manually by an engineer over the course of 4-10 days for each customer. The engineer customizes and configures the system for each company's custom use since the software allows you to do so. Regular aggregation and visualization software CAN do the same, but typically lacks data input types and features that PLTR has because PLTR has cultivated a special set of features over many years that were suggested by their existing clientele in battlefields and other places.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***#8 Other Information***\n\n***\\*\\*Big known PLTR Holders\\*\\****\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a404oalxrob61.png?width=1631&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c2dbcfac5a7ca207127771ec4e3133f8d943359\n\n***\\*\\*PLTR's Price List (2019)\\*\\****\n\n[https://www.esi.mil/Download.aspx?id=7186](https://www.esi.mil/Download.aspx?id=7186)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\\*\\*Personal TA and Crayon Mania\\*\\****\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/chart/PLTR/nrjqL4dw-PLTR-Risky-April-100-200-possibility/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/PLTR/nrjqL4dw-PLTR-Risky-April-100-200-possibility/)\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/chart/PLTR/5YcdCye0-PLTR-Schizzo-Technical-Analysis/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/PLTR/5YcdCye0-PLTR-Schizzo-Technical-Analysis/)\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/chart/PLTR/CkCTvtqM-PLTR-PLTR-train-leaving-the-station-get-ready/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/PLTR/CkCTvtqM-PLTR-PLTR-train-leaving-the-station-get-ready/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\\*\\*PLTR stock pumping events\\*\\****\n\n* 7'th Jan - Interview\n* 26'th Jan - Demonstration\n* 11'th Feb - Earnings\n* \\~15'th Feb - DPO expiration - Havoc\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\\*\\*Similar Companies\\*\\****\n\n* PLTR - Palantir - Stock Price \\~$25 - Market Cap 48bln\n* AYX - Alteryx - Stock Price \\~$125 - Market Cap 8bln\n* Semantic Research - Private\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\\*\\*Known Contract Info\\*\\****\n\n* 240 million Palantir Air Force contract expiring soon in 3 months.

I'll be holding onto it for the next year. If it's not at least 300% by then, i'm selling it and moving on to the next stock. App i'm using is Revolut.\n\nAlso yes, i'm ALL-IN only on Palantir because i know my money will multiply itself in the short term. I'm not holding this till 2025 as others are supposedly doing. I'm selling in 2022 with 300% or more profit. PLTR is severely undervalued, underpriced because it's a DPO. Give it till EOY and we're going to be rich. If it was an IPO it'd be trading at 180+ already imho.\n\nI've spent the last month and a half holding PLTR. I've gone full schizzo mode when it comes to PLTR. I lose sleep daily and i love it. I hadn't slept for 37 hours a few days ago because i spent so much time researching PLTR and scraping the internet for all possible information.\n\nI come from an IT/Development background, so i understand what PLTR does completely.\n\nMy PT's for PLTR are:\n\n* 48-89 by March or April.\n* 75 - 125 by EOY.\n* 200+ 2022 IF they solve their income and constantly increasing R&D cost issues.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4t0k1ujprob61.png?width=407&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b3a16265edafa290432e6b79f9009e3df99f495",

I'm excited to see how this and clean energy ETFs do over the next year Also, \ud83d\ude80.I don\u2019t understand, can you explain in \ud83d\ude80Well. This was amazingI \nAM NOT\nTHROWING AWAY\nMY CALLSI\u2019ve used platanir in the marine school house and that shit was scary good at presenting data in a clear understandable way. No way the government would stop using their system unless someone comes with a better data aggregation. \u201cFirst mover advantage\u201d with the government helps since bureaucracy hates massive change so as long as they continue to integrate with the government systems they locked their future to a certain extentall jokes aside, i did try to read this and it was really informative. thanks for sharing \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\ude80\"I've seen a disturbing pattern with PLTR's financials and that's that  every year, it's R&D cost is rising by between 150 and 350 million  dollars. \"\n\nR&D expenses are a positive thing. Especially in a tech company. Napkin math time, you say normally 80m a quarter but 300m this time (so 540m tot) their current mkt cap is 1.9B so their PRR is 3.5. (PRR = MktCap/R&D exp) The lower the PRR the better. Generally 5 - 10 is the sweet spot, so 3.5 is a growth indicator. \n\nAlso, interestingly Discovery Capital Management has their fingers in it. Robert Citrone co-founded that Hedge Fund and is also the largest minority owner of the Steelers. Makes me wonder if PLTR has thought about licensing their software to the NFL (Think Moneyball guys). \n\nJust some thoughts and opinions. Good DD guy.I can read, and this is great DD. Thanks palRead everything and felt like selling. Wtf? \ud83c\udf11Diners, Drive-ins and Dives? I\u2019m in.29/1 $27.5 C loadedI read the vanity fair article that claims PLTR uses a lot of data anayalst who does the gritty nitty work of extracting the data for it to make sense and its not a lot of automation involved. Can we see if that is true by looking at an expense line? Basically what they are claiming is that as the data sets get bigger and more complex, PLTR is actually losing more money because they require more and more manpower and salary.Other similar companies:  \nIBM 114bn\n\nDatabricks 6bn\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPLTR by your EOY estimation has the same market value as IBM or higher. Over 10 times higher maketcap than more similar companies like Databricks(arguably waaaaay more successful, not IPO'd yet).Zero chance I'm reading any of that.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf11\ud83c\udf11\ud83c\udf11\ud83c\udf11Great DD.   Glad you didn\u2019t mention moon or post and rocket emojisIt\u2019s enough for me that AOC wants PLTR out of the intelligence community. Either she doesn\u2019t understand what they do or she does. Fuck that bitch. 7K shares, holding forever.Great post. Short term, could it be good to sell some before 15th Feb then buy back after?This was a great DD to start my weekend with, thank you. Bought in at $9.70 because Palantir will eventually be like the pre-cogs in Minority Report or project insight from Captain America Winter Soldier.Thanks for putting this together. I\u2019ve been in since it was $15 and keep adding more whenever I get the chance. The fact that Cathie picked this up in her ARK funds says a lot. \n\nAlso - Fuck AOCI\u2019m starting to get to the point where If people don\u2019t want to think for themselves (ie last quarters numbers were \u201cbad\u201d because stock based comp which is actually a non cash charge), then those people deserve to buy in near the top. \n\nPltr is going to easily 2-3x in next 12-18 months.Thank you for this. Miss the long winded DD posts. \n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80i like your words magic man, im in, ive always been inWow. I\u2019m a small pot of \u00a31k in at $26 and you are $250k. I hope we are both right!Thanks for the work mate.\nIn my opinion you have the choice between these options:\n1. Buy under 25 dollar\n2. Wait and buy after the earnings and the Soros storyThis is great great DD. My one question is how does the dual class stock play into stock valuation when common shareholders basically have no voting rights? I\u2019m all in on Palantir, but this is literally my only concern.Thank you! I tried explaining to my wife\u2019s boyfriend but he wouldn\u2019t read\n\n\ud83d\ude80PLTR to the moon!

To the moon  \ud83d\ude80Not enough  \ud83d\ude80 . \n\n1650 shares checking in.God, I wish I could read!Great read thanks.You have just convinced me to short PLTR around earnings time.This was really well thought out and good DD. I also strongly believe that Q1 earnings will surprise to the upside and will act as the first real catalyst for the stock. \n\nAnother thing to consider is the rise of domestic terrorism further fueling the govt's need for the types of data analytics PLTR specializes in.bought PLTR calls yesterday at the top. lets fucking go bois I AM NOT THROWING AWAY MY CALLS!Remind Me 60 daysThis was a detailed and informative read. Thank you for writing it up. These are the best types of posts in this subreddit.I\u2019m long some of the 50c 2023 and don\u2019t plan on selling this yearDid the coast guard renew their contract?Dude are u manic?Didn\u2019t I see this same exact post like a month ago?upvote for the great Revolut screenshot! and a shitload of money therean extra upvote for the all-in portfolio, masterclass!Thank you.  Learned a little I didn\u2019t already know.   My question is- if you are this confident, why not get the Jan\u201923 $50 calls?  They will DRAMATICALLY outperform the shares!RemindMe! 1 monthThank you for sharing. It's so important to understand this. Good job.\n\n\n\nTo the moon400 shares, similar plan.Remind me 6 monthsOne year timeline fair enoughYou are missing intelligence community as a customer.  Im sure there are deals that cannot be reported in the books.I'm holding PLTR too. How big realistically do you think their market cap could go? 48 Billion already at a stock price around $25, is it going to be a trillion dollar company? If so how?  \n\nAlso  \ud83d\ude80I'm in on PLTR and I think I'll up my stake next week. This company can only grow, with Thiel and Karp as founders/directors that is a green light to invest. \n\nQuestion on Revolut: what's your experience on their service and can you trade options?Thanks for sharing. I\u2019m a newer investor. I\u2019ve spent most of my time in ETFs and Index funds. \n\nI think the long term aspects of PLTR look good. Short term is questionable depending on lockout. They seem to be winning contracts and doing good business from what I can tell from\nmy full fledged retarded view. \n\nI bought 2.5K worth of PLTR stock this past Friday after hearing about it on this sub. Looking at available info on the google machine, I thought it was a good risk as the company is projected to start turning a profit and the lockout and earnings date will hold the price down. Once the lockout/earnings report plays out I think this stock has nowhere to go but up. Too many upsides. You have proven people, expanding niche market that has the chance to go big time tech. They seem to be winning contracts and doing good business from what I can tell.\n\nThis is my view as a full fledged autist of course. I hope to have \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c in the long term. \n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80#9. More gains in GME.Thank you for your service100% appreciate this, I\u2019m a small bag holder on PLTR. Unbiased advice here with both a good upside and some cons.Congratulations on not mentioning Biden or Russia one time.  \n\nPalantir is about to get relegated to the dustbin of history.  They have no moat.  They have no contracts.  These dudes are just cutting an enormous paycheck at your expense.\n\nThis is a murky investment and it won\u2019t get any clearer because that would only bring the stock down.  Some insider is going to buy a few million shares and you are going to just shit yourself with excitement.\n\nThe flat out truth is not only is Palantir garbage, but it\u2019s easier to make your money elsewhere in the market.  Short term it\u2019s lost its appeal.  And it\u2019s *definitely* easier to make long money than parking it in this retarded investment.I just wanted to add that despite all these hit pieces and downgrades, the short interest in pltr remains fairly low. If institutions are so bearish on pltr, why don\u2019t they short it? That\u2019s because they are waiting for lockup to expire so they can get cheap shares and they are trying to keep the price down before that.\nAlmost forgot: palantir to the moon \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nLink: https://www.google.com/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/article/4396504-palantir-shorts-are-missingThanks man, good DD. Have about 300 shares @ about 13. Will \ud83d\udc8e \ud83d\udd90 and add to them for years, for the reasons you\u2019ve stated. \n\nAlso, PLTR has stated that their mission is, in essence, to support Western ideals and democracies; they won\u2019t do business, e.g., with China. \n\nI wonder if that plays a role in the fearmongering about this great company (eg, if you\u2019re support PLTR, you\u2019re a racist/fascist/etc.)I'm 490 shares deep! To the moon brother!If the likes of Google and Facebook don't need it because they can develop their own, why does the US government need it? They love to hire contractors to build their own unique systems as opposed to buying a COTS solution like PLTR.Great DD, it aggregates all the public info on PLTR quite well. \n\nAlthough, I think an increase in R&D cost is a good thing for companies that are supposedly growing. Especially for a company who is currently trading at around ~40x P/E. \n\nAlso, can you elaborate on why you think PT will be 50+ by April and 100+ next year? They would need to significantly increase their earnings or they'd be around SNOW levels of overvaluation (100+x P/E).TL;DR; PltR $30 bY 12/31 oR I eAT mY LeFt TeSTicLe LiVe ON tWiTCh!\n\nYeah I'm still bitter.

Take my upvote.I think people also forget that the ancillary purpose of government contracting @ DoD is to fund the next generation of tech during the valley between \"innovative new idea\" and \"broadly viable on the commercial market\".  For new tech, the value of those government contracts is gargantuan. If PLTR figures their shit out (which is *the* bet, IMO) and becomes huge in corporate america...5 or 10 years out, 25 dollars/share will seem insanely undervalued.The author of that quote is a straight up dumbass and knows NOTHING about growing software companies. If R&D was not increasing, then I would be concerned because that means they have nothing new to sell to the market. \n\nDon\u2019t read Barron\u2019s, don\u2019t read seeking alpha, etc. do some independent thinking.They are, i'm just worried because i don't know what would cause you to have to increase R&D costs by 150-350 million dollars EXTRA per year compounding. I wish Karp would put my head to rest on this somehow.\n\nI hope it's real R&D cost and not money spent on a non optimized process that will simply bloat and grow forever...I too felt a large discrepancy between the overall read and the 10x in 1 year price target lolI would like an answer to this as well.why is databricks considered way more successful?You missed the \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80s in the commentsShe\u2019s a stupid bitchExplain for us retards?

If you paid a $3 premium then you need BB to reach $13 to at least break even. The cost of the contract is premium price x 100 so for my example that single contract would cost $300. Do some more research before you get into options because you can lose money fast and easy.[deleted]Yesget ready for 600Me after buying 80 shares of tlry at 8.60 and not knowing what a P/E ratio wasThere hasn\u2019t been a catalyst. They sold some patents, \u2018settled a lawsuit\u2019 with Facebook, and had some random presentation yesterday. I have no clue what it was about but it clearly didn\u2019t blow any minds because day ended red. \n\nLet\u2019s hope as this was an accidental buy. Placed the order Thursday night thinking I could get one in on everyone. Bit me in the ass. \n\nBetween this and my 2/19 $20c on the MJ ETF, I am all in.I will need to dig thru their SEC filings. Will update when I get any new InformationI'm just a professional idiot with only half an idea how options work. I'm slowly learning. I lucked into this call when I trusted a random stranger. Thank God I have 2 months to sort out what to do with it.\n\nBut I feel like the next time it says +$300, I should sell it.If you own the call contract, it\u2019s your option to exercise, not someone else\u2019s.thanks i appreciate the info..so why is it that when buying calls the lower the strike price like below the share price the more expensive the premium is?Physical Education rate, duh.Eh they were going green all week and ended green albeit minorly on a red day before a long weekend. I think next week it will correctAlright found it (somehow first thought that it\u2019d be announced coming May):\n$90 Million cash award if stock reaches $30 before November 2023\nSource: https://www.blackberry.com/content/dam/blackberry-com/Documents/pdf/financial-reports/governance/notice-information-circular-fiscal-2019.pdf see page 29\n\nThe 2020 proxy states that he\u2019s earned ~$130M from 2017-2019; hence it\u2019d be a nice boost for his retirement although he probably doesn\u2019t need it.talking about after i sellThat is because if the strike price is much lower than the current price of the stock, you have better chances of profiting or at least breaking even. Those contracts are called \u201cin the money\u201d. If the strike price is higher than the current price it\u2019s called \u201cout of the money\u201d. When it\u2019s out of the money you need to hope and count on the stock going up a ton more and therefore it\u2019s more risky so it\u2019s cheaper. There are a ton of things to consider which I can\u2019t go into depth here but I recommend checking YouTube for more explanation. Good luck!It\u2019s not pltr earnings????so lets say i buy a $12 Call for 6/18 for $BB for 10 contracts with premium of 2.41 totaling a Max Cost of $2410, at worse case scenario if i dont reach past the break even number 14.41 by the expiration date, the worse that can happen is i lose all of the $2410 right? i cant lose any more than that to a point where they'll take more money out from my bank or from my buying power? sorry for the retard questions i feel at home\ud83e\udd23thankss again \ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffcNo worries friend, the most you can lose is the premium that you paid for the contracts. Google options profit calculator and you can see what you stand to gain/lose at different dates in the future and at different share prices. It is quite useful.You have lot of patience....good man...Using a googled calculator, my \"entry cost\" = \"premium-or-price per option\" x 100?  That is the cost to \"get in\" and if I choose not to exercise by the expiration date, I only lose that amount, correct?\n\nIf one has strong conviction a stock will go up 100% in 2 months and the cost to get in is only $170, it seems like a no brainer (I know, nothing is guaranteed)to use BB as an example (i'm completely inventing these numbers):\n\nsay BB is at $10, and you buy a call option for $3.50 with a march expiration date. you will pay $350 (3.50x100) for that. That gives you the right, but not obligation, to buy 100 shares of BB for $10/each on or before March of this year.\n\nIf the share price is below $10 it's utterly worthless, and if it's below $13.50 it's not worthless but still you lost money on the deal overall. When buying this call, the max you can lose is the $350 you paid for it.\n\nIf BB is at $20 in march, the call will theoretically be worth $10 (the difference between 10 and 20 is 10, x100=$1000). Thus you've turned your initial $350 into $1000. Pretty cool. But, if it's worth $9, you get nothing. If it's worth $12, it's worth $2 (aka $200), which means you didn't completely go bust but still lost $150 on the deal.\n\nIn this last case (it's $12 in March) spending $1000 on shares would have netted you a 20% return, whereas by buying a call you lost $150. As with everything in the financial world, there's a risk/reward at play - options are greater risk with greater reward.\n\nAlso be very cautious anytime you feel yourself having \"strong conviction\\[s\\] that a stock will go up 100% in 2 months\", as those generally tend not to play out. I hope it does, and if it did, owning a call option would be a great play. But if you're not experienced in trading options, please go easy until you understand your risk tolerance and how much you can afford to lose, because sometimes you'll hit big and all is right with the world, other times you lose it all and spiral into a void of self-loathing.

    "selfText": "I deleted a couple posts showing my $BB positions because I don\u2019t want anyone IRL seeing balances \n\n\u201cJuST mAkE a NeW acCoUnT\u201d \n\nStfu reet\n\nI\u2019ll probably delete this as well soon but I know some of you autistic bastards need to hear this now, yes you, who put market orders first thing Friday morning expecting $BB to rocket from high 10\u2019s to 15\u2019s in a single trading session. Pure majestic autism. \n\nI come out of Plato\u2019s cave to tell you I understand your pains. I was there not too long ago... you see... \n\nBack in November I noticed $BB cleanly up-trending on the hourly bouncing off the 9 and 26 MA (I use ichimoku) heading towards a resistance level that had already formed a double top \n\nLike a true Gamblers fallacy believing retard I made a wager: \n\n$10k into $6 calls expiring March on the DD that: \u201cwhat are the chances it falls AGAIN there\u201d ... that\u2019s it. \n\nA few days later AWS news came, and that $10k turned into $70k. Pure luck. Sometimes she goes, sometimes she doesn\u2019t. She went that day.\n\nIn that moment of seeing massive profits on AWS news day, I experienced violent and absolutely tremendous autism and thought, this thing is going from $5\u2019s to $15 in a single trading session, yes, even more retarded than you guys that bought the top on Friday \n\nSensible thoughts couldn\u2019t penetrate my helmet fast enough as drool gushed from my gaping mouth, gasping for oxygen and yelling at the top of my lungs what barely resembled words about Lambo\u2019s and Yachts... so I hurled about $100k into shares at $8.77 and about $10k more into $15 leaps \n\nI proceeded to watch my profit dwindle to nothing as earnings came and bent me over so hard I couldn\u2019t bring myself to watch the stock for a week \n\nI thought about selling the bottom, I was there, order ready typed, just needed to hit the send button, and I was going to close my position around $6.7ish and be back to break even after striking gold \n\nBut you know what, I remembered it\u2019s just money. I remembered that everything in reality is in flux, and changing, and decaying, and being born again, and to just flow with it and stop clinging and desiring one set of experiences over another (aka a fat bank account over giving $5 blowies behind a Wendy\u2019s) who cares? \n\nAll is well lads. So let go of the burden if you bought the top and are stressing, it\u2019s really fine. Look at what\u2019s happening right now:\n\n1) Insane volume, insane moves, erratic behavior (something is going on behind the curtain) \n\nPS: this movement and volume is NOT because of WSB, full stop. Big players are making huge moves here, and fast, we don\u2019t know why yet \n\n2) 1 Billion annual revenue \n\n3) Soon to come online a RECURRING AUTO DATA business that will drive revenue into growth cycle, BB is literally Microsoft Windows for cars but the auto sector was still underdeveloped technologically to benefit from this position, hence this vertical is finally about to print HUGE HUGE HUGE MEGA BILLIONS ANNUAL. This was always the plan and they just had to wait it out until the auto sector caught up with them digitally \n\n(The auto data tech sector is so lucrative it made Papa Elon the richest person in the world, and forced a fucking god damn phone company to join the race \ud83c\udf4e\u2014it\u2019s huge)\n\n4) UNDER, FUCKING, VALUED \n\n5) VERTICALS GALORE\n\n5) FB settled, imagine the BALLS on BB going after this massive and dirty tech behemoth run by a literal lizard, they are honest Canadians doing God\u2019s work \n\n6) IOT, AI, smart city\u2019s, insert other buzzwords \n\nI could go on and on, and honestly, I\u2019ve never felt more comfortable holding ANY stock than this \n\nMoral of the story: as I let go and accepted my circumstances and decided to diamond hand \ud83d\udc8e \ud83e\udd1a BB to the death, within a few days I proceeded to watch the fattest, thickest, randomest, greenest dildo penetrate my butt hole to the high heavens and take me from what was $70k profit to 0 profit back up to $130k profit. I\u2019ve trimmed half the options, I don\u2019t even know why tbh, reverse autism maybe, but I\u2019m riding my remaining calls and entire share position to Valhalla. \n\nWill likely add more if it dips. But...\n\nJust hold. Something is cooking on BB. You have to be a retard not to see it. Look at the fucking daily chart, look at the volume, the gaps, the swings, BB chart literally has Tourette\u2019s syndrome right now... \n\nThis stock has not moved like this for 10 years. \n\nIt might stall a little, deflate from here, consolidate a bit more, or it might blast off again any second. Point is, nobody knows when, but it looks like in a short time, we will know why this stock is moving the way it has. Something is DEFINITELY going on behind the scenes the public is not aware of and neither is the media \n\nFor fucks sake I found the court docs showing global settlement with FB is done 24 hours before gay ass Bloomberg even picked it up. The majority of the investor world still thinks they make fucking phones for Gods sake. Everyone is sleeping on this \n\nA note on Jim just in case he reads this:\n\nJim Cramer hates this stock because 1) BB and John Chen are not bootlicking CEO\u2019s jerking off CNBC and massaging Cramers asshole for air time, they\u2019re a tightly run, honorable company doing real things 2) He most likely became a bag holder during the epic fall of the BB phone and sold for a fat loss and wants to protect his ego by continuing to ignore the facts on the company\n\nThe guy wants you to invest in CRWD with a fucking ridiculous market cap, no verticals, and less revenue than BB. Promoting a literal bubble over a value play. What a bizarre world we live in. Take advantage of it, I hear this phrase all the time and I fucking hate it, but this is literally \u201cfree money\u201d \n\nKnow what you own. There is TRUE value in this company. No hype. Pure value. \n\nDiamond hand, double down, buy more, and just hold. You are in good hands \ud83d\ude4c\n\nTl;dr diamond hand $BB",

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*You couldn't be more correct. Eveything there is to find about this company is awesome, yet it's only at 5.5B market cap. \n\nThe volume is weird imo too, as well as us wsb'ers randomly picking it up roughly at the same time. I agree that this volume can't be us. There is however quite a probable explanation: BB came in the media a couple of times with positive news: Amazon partnership (huh wait what BB is in another industry than phones; EV's?!), Patent selling (huh wait what BB no longer sells phones?!), Facebook settlement (huh wait what BB no longer sells phones and has balls of steel?!)\n\nPeople are realising it's no longer the very good phone company that lost market share, it's now the very good company that does cybersecurity and is part of the EV supply chain.Already own 47 shares, will buy more if it dips again next week \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Bought 2/19 16c.

It's getting the attention from bigger players, finally. BB was trying to implement synergies with the Cylance acquisition. People are arguing the CEO has done nothing so far with Cylance. Whoever thinks you can successfully create synergies under 1-2 year without hiccups and burning through some cash is a retarded analyst. Plus the synergies are finally working out, and the hiccups are going away. This is primed for growth. Give it time and it will moon... No it will fucking leave this universe.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude803 rocket minimum.Good Lord, somebody get this man a stool so he can safely step off the short bus\n\nMost likely I would exchange those for leaps...

It works.I was just joking, the techniques for moneyball come from money (hence the name), it would be redundantWhatsApp being dirty with terms and conditions, we'll all be back on blackberry messenger soon enough. Heard it here first.Yeah I missed out on GME and went balls deep into BB.What did you guys buy calls a week out? Do longer term calls in the future, less risk and you still can get a nice payday on big moves, not as much obviously, but still. Hell, I\u2019m not even in calls, I\u2019m just long the stock, but that\u2019s also cause it\u2019s an investment for me, not a trade.I was up $4500 on BB 1/29 calls and now I\u2019m only up $1000ImpossibleSomeone doesn't follow daddy Elon.

This is still reddit, I'm gonna jump at the opportunity to tell someone they're wrong.Same...Same exact boat... :/Same, I\u2019m in at $7.52 and holding. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re anywhere near done. The market cap is still small enough for us to have an effect.We can do it!  I didn't sell BB $9c 1/22 this morning when it was up 3,200% from when I bought it, because I BELIEVE IN NEXT WEEKI bought in at $8.11 and holding. I think this has some runway. Let's fucking hope.",

Tendies for both gangs, and tendies for you.Lol have you read any of the recent news?  This shit is squeezing like your moms thighs around my head next week.Hey everyone, this guy hates money!we came here for a short squeeze...short interest has only increased in the meanwhile(and quite considerably this week), why would we leave? Main dish is still in the ovenHush. GME now, BB next.Stupid fucker GME didn\u2019t even start to squeezeYou are barely autistic you assholeThey're dealing with some massive fomosame sitting at 36.SameI don\u2019t see it going below $9.00 again after all the consolidation. A lot of people bought a shit ton as it dropped slowly today and the gap was filled up.Just bought 20 shares. That's at least 20 \ud83d\ude80 's right? \ud83e\udd72BB is a boomer product what you mean homie \ud83e\udd21Amen brother \ud83d\ude4fThat's just tendie gang \ud83d\udcb8\ud83d\udcb8As it raised over 100% \ud83e\udd26Squeeze and a huge drop. How excitingthere is a new tard bornned every dayI bought GME back in November 19. No FOMO here. Just stating the obviousI have the sams45. Every bit countsThere's alot of outstanding shares on BB that's the only thing preventing it from \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80If you've been watching it and in the game since early december, i wouldnt be so sure. It's been unreceptive to other good news. I can see high 7s or low 8s. Low 9 is still a good time to buy because it will definitely go up again next time they announce a partnership. The actual products wont come to fruition until later this year imo and it's a good long term buy if you get in low enough. Anything over 9 is paying too much right now.\u201cBB iS a bOoMEr pRoDUcT\u201d  get off Reddit and do your research homie. Theyre about to be heavily invested in the EV market and looking to integrate their technology by partnering with Amazon. They want to monopolize their technology inside the automotive industry.It's not the same product my guy. They no longer sell phones.You have no idea what a short squeeze is if you think 100% is a lot. Like absolutely no idea.You clearly don\u2019t know what squeeze meansAnd you may be right. I kept looking at the chart from the past month or so and it seems to be consolidating nicely creating a new low and then pushing the wall for a low vertical progression. I\u2019m hoping it lands around $9.00 but may drop below. I have my hands in at $9.65 and excited to hold and see what\u2019s happens with new news.They are already in the top 19 out of 25 EV makers and make up for 61% of the EV markets software. They have already began the monopolization and are succeeding more and more, and now they even got the Sony deal. More and more to come I think.They no longer cell phonesAs they restricted margin rates \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02ur good bro, carry onI first got in at 8.40 dec 1st and cost averaged down. If you can, do the same and keep buying it up when it drops lower. It really is a good stock in the long run. Dont paper hands and you'll get your profit eventually. It will probably even rocket later this year. Just wait till you can make a few bucks per share and dont get greedy. Maybe set a trailing stop loss after it goes to 10. You'll be okay but it might take a month or 2. They keep announcing partnerships so just hold strong and you wont lose.\n\nEdit:eh you're still in the green so you're not even in a bad place. Everything else applies.Better ingredients \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 better Berry \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 Papa BB \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Nope.

None of the 3 sold all of it. They probably think this is getting much higher.actual question that may be wrong for this sub but, \n\nwhen you sell puts covered by shares you already own and they expire ITM and you allow them to exercise, will the shares you own be sold to the person assigned at market value and you will automatically buy them back at the strike price? \n\ne.g you sell a put at $20, it expires with the market price at $17 so you would sell those 100 shares at market price then automatically buy them back at $20? \n\npls help am retardedThat\u2019s fuckin poetryGotta drop the stage one boosters before you start boosting stage 2!Boosters ejected.\n\nActivating second stage. \ud83c\udf19\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\ude80You know if my parents compare apple to oranges I tell them to stfu. \n\nBut you.

They'll use it as evidence that they should have an even higher paying gig somewhere else.This also helped more WSB 'traders' get in, thus giving us more power after the massive incoming gains\n\nEdit: Oh I see they sold the 13th already \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0fA little of both. I'm expecting a temporary squeeze that will make myself and others a fortune, but will use that to try and increase my position. Ryan Cohen taking over makes me very bullish on this long term. At its current state, 80+ per share is justifiable. With a transition to effective e-commerce and Chewy methodology and customer service, it can easily be worth 400+.Why not both?  I\u2019m in love with it, and trying to trade it to the fucking moon.(It\u2019s like watching Zeus come down as a mortal to mingle with humans, and nobody recognizes him...)If they sold at 36, they collectively held less than 80k shares.\n\n\n\nThose have been bought, and then some. \n\n\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Thanks for the confirmation buoysSame!He should run.

They are contracts for the right to sell shares at a certain price. So I sold someone else the right to sell me 2500 shares at $20 by january of next year. If GME stays above that, those contracts expire worthless.When you sell puts, cash collateral gets withheld from you. A $20 strike would be $2000 in collateral. If they expire worthless, you keep all the premium cost. If they get exercised, you lose all the collateral and get 100 shares. If this happens, you still keep the premium which means that you technically bought the shares at a lower cost basis than $20.I would hire them in a second. Took a company left for dead and look where we are now\n\n\ud83d\ude0e \ud83c\udf7aI\u2019m like to say they were trying a spite move to drop a ton of shares and screw the price like it was them being fired that led to a crash.  Backfired in true justiceSame here, I'm in with a lot of shares, will probably take out some, if this squeeze really moons to 200+, but GME will definetly stay as my largest position afterwards so Ryan can work his magicWhat do you foresee Cohen doing to save the company?Same I like GameStopI wonder if Ryan didn\u2019t tweet this week just so he wouldn\u2019t pump up share price even more for these 3 boomer losers.\n\nAnd for anyone reading this that still isn\u2019t following Ryan Cohen on Twitter do yourself a favor and follow him now with notifications turned on. The next time he tweets we will be mooning even more wildly than this week.Thanks for the confirmation boysWe must pool all shares into one accountDuh, it's that thing my wife does with her bf but won't with me right?Can wait 2 days to file after selling I thought?

Beyond that, I know nothing lol.\n\nI see an incredible opportunity for physical e-sports locations, VR opportunities and if I\u2019m being honest the kid in me just wants his dream of a place to visit and buy the newest haptic suit and Omni-directional treadmill. If they managed to buy out or rent struggling theatres to display on large screens or just get more space in dead malls to increase floor space after the pandemic is over and people want to get the fuck out of the house this is a growing industry that can pounce on that cheap space.\n\nBought the slump, hope to increase during the squeeze. A man can dream.What needs saving?Maybe a deal with Sony for a cut of their profits from games.That\u2019s anal.no that's called sexIf you read the Form 4 it tells you the date and price for each transactionDon't trade options in your tfsa account, just open a margin  account so you don't throw away away your contribution roomSelling naked puts is fucking retarded. Make sure you have enough cash to cover the purchase if the puts are assigned. BTW, there is suck a thing as a covered put. It's when you short the stock and then sell puts against your short position.You can't sell any type of put in a tfsa. Can only purchase calls and sell covered callsthis guy fucksIf gamestop can use its data to have the right volume on releases and be branded as \"never out of stock\" on popular items, while successfuly avoiding warehouses full of junk, they could EASILY get my business.\n\nAdd third party exclusive partnership like limitedrungames.com and a bonus sub for twitch each month and they go head to head with amazon. \n\n\ud83d\ude80 My GME fanfic \ud83d\ude80Physical esports....\n\nSo teams of people going to gamestop to use huge projector screens to play madden against each other? Stuff like that?You had me at retardeddisappointed but not surprisedThink giant arcade for all the poors with no internet cuz we keep getting screwed by the ISPs, plus marketplace / test arena for all the best VR gear. That\u2019s short term in their stores. The theatre would only work if there turns out to really be enough of an esports market to create teams competing with supporters in the seats behind them.But that sounds like it would be easy more expensive than home internet. \n\nI could see that possibly taking off,  just not for that reason.Sorry, further clarifiedWhat you are thinking of is a gaming internet cafeWhat I\u2019m thinking of is a physical location to try, buy, trade and upgrade the latest in VR tech as it evolves. I\u2019m betting every kid is going to grow through haptics like crazy and need to trade them out for new ones that fit or the latest model. It\u2019s the kid in me dreaming, but whatever.",

Seems to have solid leadership making smart decisions on how to pivot.  I was watching them through December, and now have opened a small CSP at $9 for next week, genuinely hoping it falls to that level as it's bang-on the standard dev from the 10 days.  This thing has a solid future.i bought 10 this morning and another 90 after this post hyped me up. ready for my first \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 lets goooo!Been following the sub for a bit but finally jumping on board\n\n$3.5k @$10 \n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80We're making this happenAlright, I'm counting on you retards.

Agreed the price should get to $40 based on current revenue stream.

The stock has gone sideways because theyve shown no growth during the biggest tech growth catalyst in human history.\n\nNonretards consider this a bad sign. These fuckos just tweeted about EVs and had their market cap double, just like all the other retarded profit-lite EV companies out there.\n \nGo ahead and make some money, but dont tout dumb, wrong shit or im gonna reee right back at you. This sub has become a stupid pump and dump pile of shit, and the SEC needs to think about the ramifications of it.

Its a rough ride through the weekend, but with all the stuff going on next week, we'll rally...  \n\n\nHold the front line...What should crowdstrike be trading at?B2B software always trade at 10x revenue if there\u2019s a lot of upside. And in this case there is.  Their aquisition of Cylance and recent exposure to EV and partnerships with Amzn and Sony is guaranteed to drive up revenueYour option won\u2019t fill til open and you\u2019re not gonna get the price you see now probablyAnd then slap the ask.I was lucky to buy under 8.

Don't think that's crazy.This is the ground floor really. If you look at bb news there barely any except the Huawei business.\n\nWhich is bad  because they still need to prove themselvesThe amount charged for leverage for one night is gonna be like CENTSPromising, they\u2019re partnering with Sony and supplying software for a new carYes, and higher.Both.LTHThis is the way brother, got a lone 12.5C for the same expiry at 1.50 on a whim when it popped back in December.

Might run for a while due to being so low.Placed an order for 7500 shares at openNo one is selling my $15c 2/5 :(I bought 250 shares at around $7 just before the Amazon IVY pump. \n\nI sold after the earnings, as outlook was very disappointing. Honestly, the business is operating at a big loss and they've been in the automotive business for years now.\n\nThe news with Sony and Huawei are promising, but keep in mind that the first IVY vehicles will be on the road in mid 2023, this is a very long play, and that is IF they actually pull off good unit economics for software revenue. So far, most of their revenue comes from IP licensing, which isn't a very strong growth point.\n\nI probably should have kept my shares in all honestly, feeling a bit salty and FOMOing too here, but it's already up 200% almost since a few weeks ago. The market is pricing these things in.\n\nBe careful, when the Berry burns you, it burns you bad and it hurts :(\n\nGodspeed though, all the best!BB long which strike? open?Well for me it's either my attention goes to calls or my job as SW engineer... But definitely stocking up on shares as wellYep, Made $3500 but this morning could have sold for $17.5k. It's a strange and lame feeling to be upset when you made $3500 in 1 day, but it happens when you see what you could have had...not my first time.Still buying at open?   Are there still tendies left in this.\n\n:Edit:Realistically won\u2019t think fall below $15 again soon before it goes back up? I imagine a lot of people are treating this as a PnD and shorting tonight rather than a long holdThanks! Been a long time lurker here so finally felt like I should join the forces! Hope you see nothing but green come your way fellow soldierIdk how to value crowdstrike I don\u2019t really understand it like some others in the internet space wouldLike my bid/option price or the price of BB will drop below 10?Yea if I load today I'll probably end up being 9ish EOD.\n\nDon't forget CEO john has bonus vesting up to $125mil if the stock hits $30. \n\nHe gets half ish at $16. \n\nEven if u load now it's free 50% gains are current pricesThis just in, ride it to 1000is there much of a difference between the two for potential jumps??right on - thanks brethren.

GME to the moon! Bb takes backseatI'm in shares.I'm working on learning to not look at what could have been, and instead be happy with having a good exit strategy and making money. If I play the woulda coulda game, eventually I know I will get burned..Going to buy some PM and then throughout the day.It wouldn't be a PnD if it is undervalued. It's headed to tendie town. If anything the 7% of shorts will probably start to cover as they're getting new deals.Well BB is def gonna go up not down and when it goes up the premium will go up so your total contract price will go up hence it won\u2019t fill. No one gonna sell you a cheap option when the price keeps mooning \ud83d\ude80I mean it depends how much you borrow lolExactly. I'm maxed out now.I mean, if you're trying to save 60 bucks and play it perfect sure, but you could miss out on upside doing that. Or buy in chunks.thank you sir... We all need to help each other out... I am glad to do my part...Up to 45k shares. 15k of those are on margin.Then who is?Hope you're hungry.I\u2019m on this ride baby to the moooooon fellow retards47 shares in let\u2019s ride \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80is there much of a difference between the two for potential jumps??  \n\n\nI;m in NYSE fully and worried I made the wrong move.IM NYSE \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15\ud83c\udf15\ud83c\udf15tsx please :)Shares...Who does this guy think he is giving us sad newsPapa Buffet said it best.\n\nIf you hear counter arguements to your thesis and you get mad, you are gambling.Buying right at open or waiting for dip?Totally.Its heading to ATH despite being a disappointing adventure of a company trying to find a way to market a product and make money. Not sure how you call it undervalued unless you zoom out to when they were the best cellphone manufacturer over a decade ago.Well aren\u2019t the sell options already on the market for sale? I\u2019m confused. The 9.5 option is at .39Don't worry i got fucked \ud83d\ude10Well since they make software for cars and phones and not data analytics or cybersecurity I'll let you decide...Always75 BB share gang checking inYeah, I always feel I'm fucking myself when I buy on NYSE. Like I've made some terrible mistake.beauty - saw the higher jump for [BB.TO](https://BB.TO) and panicked.  \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80is there much of a difference between the two for potential jumps??What\u2019s a sharethis did nott age well.. i bought at open and lost biglyAlready bought pm.Someone is salty they're missing out on the gain train. They're a software company now.They\u2019re starting partnerships with AMZN and SNEDid your order fill? It won\u2019t fill til open. What you see now for options ends at market close and will update at market open.\n\nOptions can\u2019t be traded after hours or premarket so prices you see are as of 4pm ET yesterday. The price increase in BB after hours and premarket doesn\u2019t get reflected in the option price yet until market opens at 930no idea, I just have a lot of XIU lolBasically stonks go up and they share their wives.Same.I'm aware but what makes them cheap other than their inability to make a profit on software? By the time they open up the market at $11.50 I don't see it as cheap at all.Ahh gotcha. So that\u2019s why GME options are so much more expensive.Cheap on a x rev and compared to competitors.I guess I've just followed and been disappointed in BB for so long I just can't get excited about it again. Big upside is that apparently they may get a cash infusion from the Facebook settlement.",

But in general, as close to atm during lowest iv and longest time frame for movement, within my budget, is what I look for in plays.15 a year outthey were going to expire, leaving any potential gains on the table anytime after 1/15. adversely potentially paying off though by taking advantage of strike price rather than paid off premium gainsI\u2019m just happy we can get in on this one before it takes off.

    "title": "$SRNE to the moon (again) \ud83d\ude80",
    "selfText": "First-time poster here, but I've been lurking since about September. Y'all brought me tendies in the form of GME and PLTR plays in the past couple months, so I thought it was my turn to repay the favor with some DD on a company that I haven't seen posted about on here yet. This isn\u2019t a short-squeeze opportunity or an ARK darling that\u2019s up 100% in the past year. The play here is Sorrento Therapeutics ($SRNE). SRNE is a biotech company which specializes in researching the use of stem-cells for cancer treatments, as well as non-opiod pain relief treatments. However, if you recognize the name, its more likely due to their developing pipeline of COVID-19 offerings. Since the outbreak began in March, SRNE has applied their resources and existing competencies to developing treatments and testing kits to combat the pandemic. In addition to their ongoing cancer and pain relief projects, they have 11 potential COVID-19 related products in various stages of the pipeline. You can view everything that they are working on here:\n\n[https://sorrentotherapeutics.com/research/pipeline/](https://sorrentotherapeutics.com/research/pipeline/)\n\nEssentially, this company is working on projects to combat cancer, the opioid epidemic, and, oh yeah the global pandemic that has dominated the planet for almost a year now. There is massive demand in all of these areas for new solutions, and Sorrento could be one of the organizations that solves part of the problem. \n\nNeedless to say, SRNE has a lot going on in its labs at the moment. However, each one of these projects represents a potential catalyst for the stock price. For example, the stock jumped almost 200% on May 15th when the company announced that one of their antibody treatments was 100% effective in inhibiting the virus in early testing. (I was holding 450 shares @ 3.15 that I had purchased purely out of excitement for their cancer and pain relief work. I was more than happy to dump them at $10.2 during pre-market on May 18th \ud83d\ude0c)\n\n[https://investors.sorrentotherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/sti-1499-potent-anti-sars-cov-2-antibody-demonstrates-ability](https://investors.sorrentotherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/sti-1499-potent-anti-sars-cov-2-antibody-demonstrates-ability)\n\nThen in August, the share price climbed to a peak of $20, apparently on pure speculation. These two examples demonstrate that this stock has a ton of interest in any news or releases on the COVID front, which arguably isn\u2019t even its main business. The share price has been volatile since August, moving within the $5-12 range over the past 5 months.\n\n**The reason I am writing this post now** is because the stock is up about 20% today, again with no news as of this posting. On December 22nd, the company filed an application for an Emergency Use Authorization for their rapid-test product with the FDA. This is where I think the real money is there to be made. They missed the boat on the vaccine race, but there is still a huge need for improved testing, which in the past has been inefficient and inaccurate. SRNE\u2019s COVI-STIX can reportedly deliver results in 2-15 minutes. With widespread availability of this testing, we could even get back to sporting events and concerts, as testing could be done quickly at the gates of the arena, and any positive cases would be turned away and refunded. SRNE is also working on a rapid spit-test, which would eliminate the need to have a q-tip rammed into your brain.\n\nNews on the potential approval of COVI-STIX is imminent, which could further send the stock price higher in the short-term. 20% would only be the first step on this moon mission, as no real news has even been released yet. It's also possible that the jump we saw today could be pure speculation and the price will fall back into the $7-8 range next week and stay there until actual news is released. I'm not saying buy or don't buy right now, but I wanted to get this DD out here before the stock really moons. Just wanted to give everyone a chance to read into this company over the long weekend.\n\nRegardless of this short-term spike, the play here is the sheer number of possible catalysts in their pipeline at the moment. The stock currently trades at a $2.6B market cap, which leaves room for a huge move upwards. The company has increased their cash while lowering debt in the last year, meaning they should be in no danger of going under in the near term. They generated $28M in revenue in the first 9 months of 2020 from their one existing product, and this revenue could double if they get any of their new products approved.\n\nSRNE closed at $9.50 today, but the **average 1-yr estimate on this company is $25**, which in my view is completely attainable if any of their products attain FDA approval and make it to the market.\n\nIf you're looking for any other reasons to get on the SRNE train, the company has a CEO in Dr. Henry Ji who publicly hates shorts as much as we all do.\n\n*\"I am giving them a fair warning shot. Just cover yourself, don't ruin your family,\" Ji said of short sellers who he says are trying to manipulate Sorrento's stock.*\n\n[https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/08/26/sorrento-therapeutics-opened-up-117-after-ceo-slam/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/08/26/sorrento-therapeutics-opened-up-117-after-ceo-slam/)\n\n(Seriously, with the amount of hype around this stock, it takes almost nothing to move it double-digit percentage points)\n\nEven after this declaration back in August, there are still 68M shares sold short as of 12/31/20. It's not GME level short interest, but it would accelerate the rockets if any big approval news is released.\n\n[https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/srne/short-interest](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/srne/short-interest)\n\nI'm not as experienced with options trading as most of you are, but if you want to buy calls I would buy them at least a few months out. The news that could send this stock up 100% is likely imminent, but it will be impossible to predict its timing since we are dealing with FDA approval here. It could be next week, it could be in March. My guess is as good as yours. I wouldn't buy any weeklies or FD's and expect to hit it big. If you like what you read here, take some of your GME profits and buy a few shares and hold on till this baby hits $20+\n\nAs always, do your own research into the stock before throwing your money at it.\n\n**Positions:** Too dumb for options so I'm holding 500 boomer shares at $7.21.\n\n**TLDR:** Biotech company with over a dozen potential COVID/Cancer/Pain Relief products in various stages of FDA approval process. Potential EUA approval for rapid COVID testing product sometime in the next month = \ud83d\ude80. CEO hates shorts. Buy shares or longer-term options to ensure that you are holding when any news hits.\n\nObligatory \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 for good luck",

GL!Sucks this came out after a 20% day but looks good. I'm always sketched out by biotech plays because they're dependent on their products getting approval. Approval up, no approval down. \n\nI'll take a position on Tuesday though, thanks!I think at any news or even fomo we could reach $30 by eomI hate SRNE but only because their job application looked like a 7 year old made itThis is the wayLmao, this is the way \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Awesome! I felt bad posting DD about a stock after a big move had already happened, but I figured a lot of people on here saw the move and I thought it would be good to illustrate that it still has some juice in it for the future.\n\nGood luck to you as well!Yeah that's my bad, there's not a big biotech presence on WSB so I wanted to post about SRNE earlier but I kept putting it off because I figured it would be stuck between $7-8 for a little while longer. I was actually waiting for it to come back down to accumulate a few more shares closer to my avg. Then this move today caught me off guard since no news has been released to justify it. But like I said, if any of their products get approved, this 20% move would only be the beginning. \n\nDefinitely do your own research on this one. Like you said, I expect it to be pretty volatile in the near-term until news is released, whether good or bad. In my personal opinion I don't see it going below 7 without news, but again, that's just a feeling from watching this stock since Dec. 2019.\n\nGood luck to you, I hope this moons for both of our sake!!I intend to buy $500 worth of FD\u2019s in this until March... assuming positive news breaks, ROI should be \ud83d\ude80",

I might do $12.5 1/29UPDATE FOR NOOBIES. \n\nWhen buying and selling calls make sure you always buy your calls first. You never ever want to open a trade selling calls without owning them first. Figured this would be useful for some of you and will save you down the road that can fuck you for thousands of bucks. \n\nSee you all on pluto.I have around 100 too which calls ru buyingI can't believe that I've made money on this POS company.420 shares yesterday\n\nLET'S GO!!!!!I mean at this point you really don\u2019t have much of a choice, eh?Sitting at 12That shit won\u2019t get filled, the pre-market hype will be high.

I\u2019d be 0DTE if it let meIm in at $11 1/29What do you mean? If you\u2019re selling a call you\u2019d have to own the call in the first place correct? How would you get fucked?

Last I checked they are at $10.42We are riding it to Pluto my man.Diamond hand is must till before close of expiration!\ud83d\ude80Honestly anything is good. If you're not as bullish, go for a lower strike price. I gambled a measly 10 1/15calls at $10 and I was already up aftermktOh yeah, duh. I'm swinging ARBKF so let's see. I'll probably be priced out when it hits but this is the first time I've caught onto a WSB pumpSoon it will be Bang bros in BusSee I guessed Blackberry but my dumbass was doubting and thought Best BuyOof is right. Idk I made 5k with what I sold it and bought. But still. If it dips I may get back inGoogle it. \n\nCall options - strike price - expiryIt is a call option with a $12 strike price. Look up options trading.I've been broke and I've been broke and I choose to rich everytime LFG \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Yea I\u2019m probably not gettin in on thisThanks for explanation broSee if you buy there won\u2019t be a dip, so let\u2019s just do that. I\u2019m I\u2019m for 175 premarket.Did I fucking stutter?Every moment you wait is the dip. It\u2019s all up from here \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\u201cSafe bet\u201d isnt iv 300%We don\u2019t do safe, we do space missionsFor 1/29?Wouldn\u2019t it expire tomorrow? So what would you have to do? Sell it or exercise it? (Also idk what it means to exercise it)Nah , you can actually sell a call without buying one first,  you just need to put a margin in to be allowed to do that tho , it's very risky and I don't recommend it . Selling a call outright basically means you are selling someone to buy 100 shares of X stock . You would basically be writing a contract. \n\nWhen you buy a call however you are buying someone else's contract so when you sell it you are basically selling the original contract you bought.When you go to trading options you have the option to buy or sell a call. You can technically sell a call without owning it , if you do this and the buyer of you call excersises his call option you would be held liable for 100 stocks. \n\nIf you buy a call option , let's say  1- $15c 1/29 and then sell it for a profit loss  you wouldn't be held liable since you started with buying a call .\n\nSelling a call outright without buying one first and called shorting and will hold you liable for a chance of assignment.$15C 1/22 LFG \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Godspeed! I bought 165 shares in early December.For sure appreciate it!Grats and fuck you. \nWhat calls are you thinking?\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02LmfaoOK IM BUYING IM BUYING LETS GOI laughed so hard coke came out my nose.  Had to cut her hair off and sift it to put it back in there.Sorry, I'm a young buck who's new to this. I hear ya loud and clear!Any ideas then? Otherwise sharesYeah for 1/29I can still sell before 12 pm PACIFIC TIME.  But I am definitely not exercising it.Oh ok thanks for clarifying, it\u2019s taken me two straight days for my autist brain cells to synapse this infoWonder what we are gonna be eating on PlutoYoooo I didn\u2019t selll off them calls wtfThis is a total noob question I can probably just get 6 contracts and I\u2019ll probably do $12c 1/29 but would I make less money if I bought 46 shares instead of the call? Both cost the same amount reallyNo worries . We aren't wall street , we share the wealth mother fucker.  Lets get this money.A call is worth 100 shares. \n\nThe amount of people who have no idea what calls are on this sub is retarded. \n\nYou are buying the option of buying 100 shares at a set price. \n\nSo $12c 1/29 means you are buying the option to buy 100 shares at $12 on the 1/29. \n\nIf the price goes to $13 then you have a contract worth ~ $100. If the price hits $15 then you have a contract worth $300. \n\nIf you buy 6 calls at $12 and the shares hit $15 then you will have contracts worth $3600. \n\nIf you buy 46 shares at $10 and they reach $15 you will have made $230.Dude honestly I\u2019m pretty noobie when it comes to this too, but if u want long term growth, I think u gotta go with the shares.This is gonna be my first options trade im scaredAll in 15c\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80More risk in calls but more reward. If you don't hit your strike price by expiration your investment goes to 0. You could always sell out prior to expiration though. Each option contract gives you control of 100 shares so it's really levering up that initial investment.For options, dip your feet slowly.  Dont spend your while wad prematurely.  Also start with longer expiries as opposed to really short dated ones until you get a better feel for IV, hype, and greeksAlso what do you think about $12c 1/29? Are you gonna put in positions tomorrow at open?Thank you for explaining it to me!!!I'm in the Sept $10 calls. I got it today when the stock was at $9. Hopefully see a good return on this already tomorrow but I'm holding it through. I think this stock has room to run. I think it will hit $12 by 1/29 but you have to see what the premium you're paying on the option is. For example, if you're buying the $12 and paying $2 per contract that means  the stock needs to hit $14 for you to break even. From what I saw earlier today, the premiums on the further out options were cheap for the upside. I got my calls for 2.80. If I was going in for more I'd look at the $15c further out but $12 1/29 may not be bad depending on that premium.  Stocks up big after hours so everything is going to jump tomorrow morning.that's gonna be pretty risky with only about 2 weeks to expiryI\u2019d literally pay you to mentor me.. thank you so much for helping me understand. So if I did $10c  1/29, and since that\u2019s the deeper ITM, the less the stock has to rise in order to break even. Would that be a better/safer call?No, if it's deeper in the money you will have to pay for that. It is embedded in the price of the call. There are several inputs to the price of the call including the share price, the strike price, how volatile people think the stock will be (higher during events like earnings releases), and time until expiration (theta). If you buy a $10c and the stock is $11, there is already $1 of intrinsic value that you have to pay for in addition to paying for the other components. If it's at $11 and you buy an $11c then there is no intrinsic value and you're paying for only the other components. As you move the strike higher from the share price the lower the option will cost just due to the lower probability of reaching it. If you pull up yahoo finance you can look at the options and see how the price changes based on different strokes, expiration dates, etc.  There are also implied volatility calculators out there that can show you what is priced in. When some of these stocks get moving you can see implied volatility of 100%+ which means you're paying a steep premium.",

Let's imagine you are a big swinging dick hedge fund and you want to buy a ton of shares and ride this thing to the moon. But there's still a ton of shares not available for you to buy yet (feb lockup). Of course you aren't going to let it soar preemptively before you have loaded up. \n\nOnce lockup expires start accumulating your positions in the following days / weeks and hold forever.PLTR is extremely predictable and easy to play. Buy when it hits 23/24, sell at 26/27.

Long term is EOM OTM calls instead of EOW OTM calls.People should sell long dated puts. you can get almost $9 right now for a november $25. You only tie up like $1k of buying power, absolute worst case you get shares at a $16 cost, if it just sits around and goes no where or goes up you make almost a 100% return on the buying power you tie up.Too real.yes just like $TSLA3/19 $10c checking in2 contracts of the same checking in \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80This guy Jelly ^\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udeecWell done Foreignbrohe's also got the worst moves of the threesource?For sure!!!!!

I believe 80% of shares will be available for trade after that. Currently I think its only around 20%The day to day prices are different than the big green chart you see. It only reports one price per day when looking at a 3m view, and you don't see the fluctuations that i'm talking aboutDumb question: how are up when it hasn\u2019t hit $10?Same! So I sold some more stuff and bought a Mar $9 and a 2023 $10 callYOLOWhat is their product exactly?Secrets of the trade my friend ;)They don't want us to make money but eventually they will have no choice.Bought 155 (my entire account) sometime this morning, pleas fly againBro, did you even see that sweet 4% AH?What the fuck. What\u2019s your % gain rn bro I need stuff to jerk off toSqueeze me bbyi have apha stocks and calls and the other two... same with BB but with 10 8.5c 1/22 instead... hoping for 20 so i can ring that register.$1500 in $9c expiring on 1/22. Wish me luck boystrust meSame. Ridiculous.Already 20It\u2019ll hit 10 today, 20 next week, then the moon. I\u2019m in @7.40 ;)If BB jumps from $9 today to $20 sometime in the future, that contract for $430 will be worth a lot more (because the underlying asset of BB is more valuable). You could sell to close the contract at any time between now and expiration and take the difference, or, for a call option you could exercise the option at expiration and purchase the 100 shares of BB at whatever strike price you chose. Most people sell the contract before expiration and pocket the profit.Please stop using options till you read some stuff on how it works.Lol dude I don't use RH. I'm literally looking at it on Bloomberg I can see intraday pricing just fine, that's still not a pattern that's repeated more than 3 (maybe 4 depending if you have some leeway around your ranges) times. Hardly something I'd call extremely predictable especially when it's a brand new range for the ticker to begin with...Value of a call is (Intrinsic Value) + (Time Value).  Intrinsic Value is 0 until the stock reaches the strike price.  But Time Value is more complicated, it increases as the share price climbs, and decreases (or decays) as time elapses.  So the value of a call option goes up when the stock goes up, even when it is \"out of the money,\" as long as they go up fast enough to beat the time \"decay\".because people are so certain that it will which makes them willing to pay more for that contract.  If it stayed at that price until expiration, the value would go down.I placed an option order this morning before market but it\u2019s not reflected yet? Anybody help me out?Pffft, wouldn\u2019t YOU like to know \ud83d\ude0eDarn I have the perfect meme video for PLTR I just need to get something working for an hour to make it. Will try again tonightThe minute buyden appointed Avril Haines as director of intelligence was the moment I knew I had to go all in[186% today, 28% overall](https://imgur.com/a/ElCBX7u)That\u2019s gonna land way in the money. Did you pick them up cheap?But why?I literally bought them just after open too for $1.02. Should have stayed at the doctor incase my erection lasts longer than 4 hours.In at 9.10 lets get it.Thank you for explaining this moreAnd the option holder would get $100 for every dollar above their strike price? Ex. $9 contract goes to $20 430 goes to 1530?I mean you're right, i've done it 4 times. But 10% per month is a pretty great return is it not? AMD and Netflix used to do the same way back when, as did TSLA.the time value of GME calls this afternoon was PEAK MONEY.This is probably one of the most concise and well put ways to explain this that I've seen.So the contract itself is fluctuating? As well as the stock? I so so dumbWell well well... I somehow missed that in my DD.\n\nGood lookin out!Yeah like $0.50/contract. \n\nI\u2019m rock hard rn looking at these AH numbers\n\nI also have GME calls that are about to print lolYou wanted a DD not a god damn philosophyI wanted to buy 20c for next year, option was not there.emptied my load at 8.53 lets take it all!!!Option have a value called delta. It determines how the option price changes with regard to the stock. For strikes near the current price(ATM: At The Money) , it's usually about 0.5 meaning for every dollar the stock goes up the option goes up $0.5.\n\nThe lower the strike, the higher the delta.The contract value will vary with time and stock price. It's not a direct 1:1 ratio.Sure I'm not saying that's not a great return, just that thinking it is \"extremely predictable\" when it's only held the range a month and a half is setting you up for heartbreak. I trade ranges on FX which are wayyyyy more stable, and still managed to get burned and lose a few months of profit being the wrong way (and trying to buy the dip) through March when USD rallied hard. And have missed out on some fantastic gains when a huge rally occurs after selling at my PT. Which again, is fine, as long as you know that's how you're playing the stock. You just have to be ok with missing out on the gains in a sustained one way rally...Because changing your mind and FOMO'ing in is usually one of the worst things you can do (unless it's TSLA).exactly, the contract price is fluidYeah which is why some people can make profits on super OTM options when the stock never even gets close to the strike price but is heading in that directionFuck yeah. I missed the GME rocket ship but I\u2019m strapped in for BB (relative to being the poor that I am, anyway).I bought 1000 shares too because my old man still uses a blackberry.I ended up not pulling the trigger on 3/19 $10c. It was in my price range and I just didn\u2019t do it! Regretting it today after chasing like an idiot. I am so close to doing this right\n\nGuess I\u2019ve got til March for it to come back a little.I guess that\u2019s where I\u2019m stuck. I understand that the contracts fluctuates, but how does the stock price effect it?Fair. I hope you're having a nice Thursday my guyGME this week was fun, but the real win for me was actually a 300% play on Tilray calls. I\u2019ve rolled the profits from that into some more later dated Tilray calls and *those* are printing too (and that\u2019s before the opt price reflects this AH fun)\n\nMy account is up like 26% this week. It\u2019s been a good weekLol amazing.\n\nMy only regret if not buying enoughhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black\u2013Scholes_equation\n\nOption price varies based on a number of variables. \n\nYou are partially correct however\u2014***at expiry*** the option\u2019s value is equal to (share price-strike price) x $100 (if it\u2019s a call)That's where the greeks come into play, my man. The delta of an option determines how much the price of the contract fluctuates as the underlying stock value moves.As the other redditors have explained there are many factors at play which determine a contract's price. I'd simply reiterate that the stock price is one underlying value which directly affects your option contact's value. \n\nFor example:\nIf I sell you an option to buy a bar of gold today for $1,000 and the price of a gold bar is also $1,000, then your option is not worth anything (because you can buy the gold bar in the market for the same price I'm giving you the option for). However, if tomorrow, the price of a bar of gold is $1,200, all of a sudden the option I sold you to buy the bar of gold for $1,000 has a higher worth. Most people would sell the option to buy the gold and pocket the profit before the option expires (in case the price of gold bars drops below $1,000 tomorrow). Other people might exercise their option at expiration, and hope that gold is worth more than $1,000 (so they can sell it for a profit or hold on to it long term, if that's their goal).\n\nJust replace \"gold bar\" with \"stock option\" in the example above and that's the general idea.\n\nI didn't realize that most people don't hold options all the way until expiration and instead sell them for a profit until I started trading options.

Broadly speaking, the term may refer to a similar PDE that can be derived for a variety of options, or more generally, derivatives. For a European call or put on an underlying stock paying no dividends, the equation is:                                \u2202        V                     \u2202        t                     +                 1       2                    \u03c3            2                    S            2                                           \u2202                  2                        V                     \u2202                S                  2                                     +     r     S                        \u2202        V                     \u2202        S                     \u2212     r     V     =     0         {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\partial V}{\\partial t}}+{\\frac {1}{2}}\\sigma ^{2}S^{2}{\\frac {\\partial ^{2}V}{\\partial S^{2}}}+rS{\\frac {\\partial V}{\\partial S}}-rV=0}  where V is the price of the option as a function of stock price S and time t, r is the risk-free interest rate, and             \u03c3         {\\displaystyle \\sigma }  is the volatility of the stock. The key financial insight behind the equation is that, under the model assumption of a frictionless market, one can perfectly hedge the option by buying and selling the underlying asset in just the right way and consequently \u201celiminate risk\".\n\n[^(About Me)](https://np.reddit.com/user/wikipedia_text_bot/comments/jrn2mj/about_me/) ^- [^(Opt out)](https://np.reddit.com/user/wikipedia_text_bot/comments/jrti43/opt_out_here/) ^(- OP can reply !delete to delete) ^- [^(Article of the day)](https://np.reddit.com/comments/k9hx22)\n\n**This bot will soon be transitioning to an opt-in system.

He\u2019s the only the 3rd CEO and 1st outsider in the company\u2019s history who\u2019s very optimistic about a turnaround\n\n- they\u2019ve sold non-core assets and expect to raise additional $350mm-$450mm in cash from non-core that will be pushed towards digital sales\n\n- Digital Comps up 94% YoY. Penetration online continues to grow drastically with a 31% annual growth rate\n\n- More digital means wider margins. Gross Margins increased from 32.2% to 35.4% which simply means they make 3% more on every sale which is huge. \n\n- They\u2019ve increased the planned share buy-back from $675mm to $825mm in the next 3 years. That\u2019s 1/3 of the fucking float which signals the confidence of the management \n\n- Haters might point Net income was negative. True, but it was mainly due to $2.469 billion NON recurring  restructuring cost. If we omit that cost, the net income over the past three years is +$500mm. \n\n- EV/EBITDA is 10.01 vs conservative 12.7 industry average at the time of this post. So that alone should put us at a fair value of $35/share today. Based on forward EBITDA for 2021, that\u2019s $39/share in the next 12 months. And that\u2019s not accounting for share buyback.\n\n\nSounds good right. But wait, there\u2019s more\n\n\n-BBBY is the 5th most shorted stock over $1 billion MC with 68% of short float.

And if you\u2019re right you have the right but not the obligation to sell your shares or something?What position?Both are goodProfit on a call is unlimited, profit on a put is limited by the fact the stock can't go lower than zero. There is some after hours things you can do but its limited.are you meomg I found my people.No one knows how to do anything here, retardOnly some brokers allow it and only after you make a special request.  \n\nBut don't worry,  you can buy shares now and strap on for the ride.Beware of the options!I bought an option once. Cost me $140.\nThats the whole story.I had 4 options for $12.5 and I sold them all at close today. Made a ton of money but I could\u2019ve made moreSo $75?This killed me when I was trying to buy more GME, had money waiting to go in but due to the holidays(banks closed) it took a while. Couldn\u2019t buy more at the dip when it was around $14, by the time my money was in it was $17. Though after last two days, not the worst case scenario.Roger that, I'm in!500 shares \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80  how about to the \ud83c\udf1a\ud83c\udf1a\ud83c\udf1aBeep boop beep boop \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80This was my approach.

All we gotta do is pick the next meme stock and here we go :)Should I do $10c 3/19 when the market opens tomorrow? I\u2019m think of doing that, it\u2019s gonna be my first options buyWhen you say 10$ calls does that include the premium or that\u2019s just the strike priceStocks can go down, Stonks only go up\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80>\tAlso BB \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nThis is the most important point.Widely considered some of the most secure endpoint technology (mostly in vehicle computers) on the market - with self driving/more computerized cars on the horizon those things need to be hyper secure. Plus Canada. Plus recognized name.\"making stuff\"I know it\u2019s a month old, but it gives a little more context other than because r/wallstreetbets posting rockets.\nBut just in case: \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80I\u2019m going to watch it for a little bit, might buy more calls if it looks like a longer term trend, I think it will though, next GME! \ud83d\ude80Yeah my calls are dropping, I\u2019m hoping tomorrow it will bounce up again.I wondering if I should sell my 9$ callsI NEED TO KNOWSooo, 20-never?I think I'll stick with shares for now until I do some more research!Would you recommend I buy $7c 3/19 tomorrow or $12 1/29I\u2019m dumb and trying to be less dumb. Why buy at $7? Isn\u2019t it at 10? I\u2019m missing this crucial part!\n\nYou answered this in a later post never mind. Thank you!New here. Why a $7 call when it's at 9~ currently unless you expect it to go down? Eli5?\n\nI made a 15c for 1/22 because I have no money and I had the funds in my accountI would honestly buy straddles if you gonna play. BB has been giving up gains every pop. I\u2019m super long term on blackberry 370 shares and 3 7C\u2019s 2023(I have a small account). Premiums are gonna be al types of fucked. Wait for the eventually dip and get in long. Let IV chillWhat date did you set it for?It\u2019s not better or worse, it was just a cheap premium and I\u2019m optimistic for the stock to take off. 1/29 $12c is perfectly fine if you\u2019re looking for a shorter term play, seems fine to me if the premium allows you to buy the volume you wantit's a call, not a put.\n\nyou're buying a contract to purchase 100 shares of $BB for $14/share on or before 2/19. So if it goes over $14, you make money. Let's say it's $15, you exercise the option and buy those 100 shares for $14, so you're automatically up $100.\n\nWhat happens more often though is that people buy and sell just the contracts without necessarily exercising them. So like I buy a contract for 1/15 9c and I pay $0.27/share ($27 total price for the contract), then the stock goes up and suddenly the ability to buy shares at $9/ea becomes more desirable so the price goes up and now that same contract is worth $0.54/share, or $54. \n\nso to somebody who has the capital to exercise it, they see that the stock price is currently $9.60/share, which would be $960/100 shares, or they can buy my contract for $54 and buy 100 shares for $9 per the contract = total price for them comes to $954.Nah, 14 is the strike price, depending on his premium it might have to reach 15+ to break even. He won't buy the shares., instead he'll just sell the option so some other retard will buy it.All of them.Thanks for the info!We are all the same.That was all my parents would let me borrow. \ud83d\ude02Yea that\u2019s not bad at all, such a bad time to make a deposit on my part before a weekend lolAll in on 1/15 20c \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Ive been in since 2018....get me back to green boys. 300 at $13.01 and still have room to avg down lolBut what happens if it goes wrong?Just trying to \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 my way through lifeFuck \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b boomers and anyone else, Long Live BBNone of us know what we are doing all we know is stocks only go up \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Also new.  If you bought 1 contract and it failed to hit strike price, do you now owe the cost of 100 shares of the stock, or have you just lost the max price?Bro, 3k savings from last few months all in. I don't got knee surgery but hey \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 rightAlso has to be small enough, let\u2019s not kid ourselves, we\u2019re not influencing Amazon, but we can influence small and mid cap stocks... and Tesla for some reason..Yeah, of course it'll give it plenty of time to get wayyy above the breakeven.\n\nRemindMe! March 19, 2021Strike price. I paid an avg of $0.90 for each so I've already made money.Context<\ud83d\ude80It also went up on that news and then went down right after even after good earnings.\n\nI'd love to know the real reason it spiked besides everyone happened to remember the whole amazon thing.Nah bro that shit is gonna print.you got itYou still might profit, but generally buying OTM calls with a short expiry is very stupid. Its always safe to just buy slightly ITM calls for a bit longer period out7c is too far ITM for how far it moved after hours. Something like a 2/19 9c wouldnt be bad. But dont wait much longer after market open because its going to moon.Because the deeper ITM you are, the less the stock has to rise in order to break even. Since you are so far out OTM on short expiry, you\u2019re more likely to lose your money. But this is a meme stock so it has crazy growth, who knows.So essentially they\u2019d either spend $960 for 100 shares of a stock at $9.60 OR they spend $954 for 100 shares at $9 right?\n\nThe latter being the obvious choice because they not only pay less but they\u2019re getting the stock at a discount. \n\nAm I understanding right?This is the type of comment I\u2019ve been looking for, THANK YOU!Now is the time to learn. I rarely do options (FD\u2019s) and I\u2019m all-in here. Now you can be like the GME autists.My moms boyfriend said not to gamble the money.

Appreciate it.correct. you can generally expect contracts to sell for the difference between the strike price and the share price + a slight discount.\n\nedit: which is also why calls can have such impressive gains, because they can be really cheap when they're out of the money and really valuable when they're in the moneyGood callToo late for that, I am now Mrs CohenJust bought 4 1/29 10c because yolo \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80He says like we didn't put the GME shorts in the poor house last week xDYeah you would probably be fine with that.i\u2019m new.

GME seemed weird, but it made a lot of sense if you informed yourself properly. BB is just some wanna-be stock imo. Could be entirely wrong thoughIt fucked me today and I\u2019m not proud of it. Red is bad, apparently.When you sell a $16 covered call back in November... That's how you get Fed on PLUG.He\u2019s probably riding the short busMan I\u2019d go yolo it and then it would tank. I should\u2019ve gotten in a couple days ago for the fresh tendies. Imma stick with BB.I\u2019m the original autist.Thank you, you guys are awesome. Much love!I\u2019m in for $10k, let\u2019s go \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Doneor maybe 3 used models?Current M3 is superior in every way so you need to wait until after the refresh anyway.So are we anticipating BB to moon now or???Ok. Lesson learnt.are you fucking stupid WSB absolutely caused the squeeze. We owned like 20% of the shares.I'll bet my kids future on the memeability of this one.BB is also easy to spell which is a real plus.Been awhile since I hopped on a meme so goddammit I'm in.  AH stonks and callz tomorrow.Soon9/17 $9C and I\u2019m in the money after only 7 days with 8 months before expiry and no idea what to do with calls that far away6/18/21 $15 call. Up 265% today. 40 contracts, finally in the green today. Up about $1600Bought the 10 and 12.5 back in Aug... up 600%+ and 400%+ since. \n\nBe wary, it pulls back over time but the news is buzzzzzzzzzinYou are stupid, but probably more confused than stupid.\n\nLEAPs work just like any other option, they're just a year+ out.\n\nThe nice thing about them is they derive a large part of their value from time, so they stay worth a lot of money even if price goes against you.\n\nthey have a strike price just like any other option and if the strike price is below current price, you are ITM on a call and OTM on a put. Just like any other option.Calls or sharesOnly conference I found on BB's press release site is at 1:15 pm EST: \n\n[Needham\u2019s 23rd Annual Virtual Growth Conference](https://wsw.com/webcast/needham103/bb/1838040)  \nFriday, January 15th, 2021 at 1:15pm ET  \nRyan Permeh, BlackBerry Chief Security Architect & Co-founder of Cylance and Eric Cornelius, BlackBerry Chief Product Architect in virtual conversation with Richard Valera, Needham & CoI think it\u2019s at 1:15pm ET. It\u2019s their Annual Virtual Growth Conference.30 here lol1:15 ET iirc...You will most likely want to get in early and fast. BB's ceo Chen just announced deal with Sony.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I'm an autist, please make sure to not take my advice.STOCKS ONLY GO UPI only got 2 - BB  1/21/22 $10C1:15 I thinkThe futureClick BB\n\nTrade options\n\nBuy call\n\nMake sure Jan 15th is selected\n\n\nSelect your strike price\n\nClick buyI bought a few hundred shares in the 6s. Sold bc it wasn't moving fast enough. Oops.People were talking about BB far before that, you\u2019re the one needing to catch on you autistLeaps?Where do you go for solid leap DD?Was joking. Entered in when options were trading ~0.10LeverageFor the most part people do not exercise their options, even if they are far in the money. They usually get sold before expiration, or expire worthless if you made a bad bet.You can resell the option contract and keep all the profit from the stock value increase. (without buying stock)100 shares is $900. But 10 contracts at .90 each is 1000 shares for $900. So much more profit/loss potential for the same price for those who are lower on capitalYou can make way more buying options than shares. If you buy 100 shares at $9 and he sells at $18 he's only making $900 in profit. And that's assuming the price doubles. \n\nMeanwhile he could buy options for February or March for a $10 or $15 strike and make significantly more than $900.

Also tradestation and interactive brokers, but aprooval takes a few days.Interactive brokers or tastyworksYou won't be able to trade options in the UK, however you can trade CFDs or spread bets which both allow you to leverage you money.

See you on the bright side of the Moon! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80What call should I make for tomorrow? Do I buy one set to expire tomorrow?I think you're lost, r/investing is -> that way.I bought 1 call cause why not. Dumped the rest in shares. Retards to the endI literally opened my trading account like 3 days ago and all this is new to me. I was told options are complicated so it kinda scared me away. I bought a 2/5 $11 call @$1.06 just to see what happens tomorrow. Hope this works out.how is that percentage calculated? What did you pay for the call and what's the target? \ncan you explain to me: options are shares make the same amount of money or not? \n\nlet's say the stock is $10, and you have $20 call. \n\n* you buy 100 shares for $10 (-$1k) and sell for $20 (+$2k) you made $1k profit\n\n* you buy a $20 call for $X (idk how much, but i assume not much, say -$100). Then you exercise the call to get 100 shares, you pay -$900 ( $10*100 - what you already paid, correct?) and sell for +$2k). It's the same $1k profit right? \n\nSo the percentage you listed is the difference between call cost ($100) and net profit ($1000)?? So in this example it's 900%?At what strike and premium?Exactly what I told myself \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80for once im glad I didn't inverse OP. good call my guy9.50 1/22 checking inMe too.

Had to make two 911 emergency phone calls in life or death situations then. Both times someone died. In one of those situations the victim could have been saved if they could have gotten there seconds sooner. But.. Both times the emergency call dropped. Fucking dropped! Just like their \ud83d\ude80. Through the investigations they found that the call dropping was 100% the devices fault. I found out then that they were notorious for dropped calls and very quickly bought a differant brand phone. When I told one of my engineer friends over at Black Berry this, he confirmed to me it was a known issue. He is now one of the department heads.. Love the guy.. But yah.. Fucked up..Screw it sold some T and bought 22 more of the same. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80I heard they were gonna discuss some things Friday so I believe there isNews tomorrow according to post, sell tomorrowyes, he really did miss itI had some money put aside...it is my destiny.

Most people don't actually take the shares, they just sell the contract at a higher priceFor selling a call option, are you only exchanging the premium? Do the stocks themselves ever change hands?

Assume the premium jumped to $1 per share.\n\n$1x100=100.\n\nHe can now turn around and sell that call and make $90 in profits on the premium without exercising the call at all.\n\n$90/$10=900% profit.\n\nFull disclosure I'm a super noob retard and learned this from a YouTube video yesterday.I went this route too.

IDK, maybe up is actually down and down is up.yeah. when PLUG shot past 70 I thought I was done. Missed out. But it paired back to 65. I am going to load up on this one if it falls to 60.I bought at 49, sold at 53 to buy nio. Totally missed gme. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing.

Expected console sales were already priced in. It's not like the console release was a surprise that came out of nowhere. It's pretty well known gme didn't get many given to their stores too. That exact number won't even be released till April. \n\nThe short squeeze hasn't even happened yet either. \n\nThe only big catalyst is Cohen and the two other chief executives joining leadership to rebuild gme's business model.Covid will probably last another year at least.Im pretty sure from a reliable source that the bankruptcy will be inevitable this year.How?  Sell the original and buy more?  Why would that be more beneficial than hanging on to the original that was purchased at a lower premium?I\u2019m a bit worried this is going to be a palantir redux where it rises fast, but the. it\u2019s stagnant for a long time, and a better use of capital would be to sell one or two contracts to invest somewhere else that\u2019s on the verge of busting through.You should buy shares. \n\nA call is where you\u2019re buying the rights to 100 shares and basically you\u2019re gambling on the possibility it will go up to a certain amount by a certain date. Rocket potential upside and catastrophic potential downside (if it doesn\u2019t reach what you predicted it would, you lose 100% of it, and it goes down quickly if you guess wrong). Also, once the rocket has initiated liftoff, you e pretty much missed the possibility of making a profit on calls. \n\nTLDR: buy shares until you\u2019re ready to go full R.Calls are bets that the stock will go up in the future and give you a right to buy 100 at a certain price (or you can sell the contract)Only one rocket emoji is terrible. Time to buy puts!DD?Sadly you can\u2019t trade options on Etoro (neither Revolut, which - as a Europoor - I\u2019m using. Thinking about switching to Interactive Brokers).\nBefore you get into options trading, definitely watch videos / read about it first. It\u2019s a fuckin\u2019 casino: it can give way higher returns than just owning a share, also zou can easily lose all your money (see posts flaired as \u201cLoss\u201d, aka lossporn).\n\nAlso welcome to WSB, happy trading and fuck you in advance for your gainz to come ;).Hmmm strange I just checked and its there for me. Next to \"discover\"If you go back to the trade options page, to the left of the dates you should see a tab that says \"Discover\"\n\n\nI recommend clicking that and reading through the Robinhood info they provide on that page and then watching a few Youtube videos.\n\n\nI've read countless reddit posts/comments about options trading but what really helped me was seeing others do it via a video and then making some low risk ones myself.Hell ya!! Quick question you may know. I bought calls after market for .83 cents. Will they now not go through bc the post market? I\u2019m an idiot!!!No shit, retard.The guy who sold it to you is hoping that it expires worthless, so no stock ever has to change hands. And the vast majority of people buying calls are not doing so with the hopes of obtaining 100 shares of a stock, but rather to have that contract itself rise in value so they can sell the contract for a profit. But once it's been created, that option basically goes into a pool of options at the same strike and expiration, so sellers aren't under contract with a particular person, but more just the market itself.\n\nAt least that's how I think about it in my limited understanding, I'm far from an expert, having just started this hobby of messing with options after Fantasy Football season ended. I'd recommend checking out some basic options tutorial type videos on youtube if you've got a little time, the basics can be grasped fairly easily IMO.Check out https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/\n\nIf you really want to learn and you use Robinhood, this video is as good as it gets:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SD7sw0bf1ms\n\nYou should really be thinking of options as just that, options. You are paying a **premium** to buy a **contract** which gives you the option to **buy 100 shares** at the desired **strike price** anytime from now until the **expiration date**. You can **exercise** this option at anytime, or you can sell the contract back for a profit/loss.\n\nBut yes, it's essentially a \"bet.\" I think that video explains all you need to know. Watch it in chunks so you don't overwhelm yourself.Yes[https://tastyworks.com/](https://tastyworks.com/) accepts europeansHow much were they this morning?You've never heard of Van Guh?It means Out of The Money, aka higher than the current price.ITM - inside the money\n\nATM - at the money\n\nOTM outside the money. unless its BB then everything will be money come  \ud83d\ude80 Friday \ud83d\ude80Thank you.

So OTM PUTS?My sources have told me GameStop inc. is done and not just on twitch.The farther OTM an option is, the more money it makes moving closer to ITM.\n\nThe closer the expiry, the more money it makes as it moves closer to ITM.\n\nTake profits from a conservative leap that printed early and roll them into a closer expiry or a farther OTM or both. \n\nIts definitely an increase in risk in exchange for a larger profit %.\n\nEdit: If IV has changed drastically, maybe hold onto the original?

(Im only few days old here lol)100 fooldo you have to buy all 100?BBI'm not the one to ask, I have no idea how options work. I just buy them. No you\u2019ll need to readjust at open for a higher price. Since it mooned after close today the options prices you see currently won\u2019t fill.Trying some covered calls with BB let\u2019s see how that goes.If the stock rises to make the option valuable, why would someone *ever* sell it? Wouldn't they get a significantly better margin just executing and instantly selling the shares? Maybe they think the stock won't rise enough and try to sell it to someone who thinks it will. But that's it, really.\n\nIf you aren't buying the option to hold the shares, I guess the only reason to sell it is the edge case that you fail to believe in it anymore and want to reap back some of the premium you paid. Maybe?Just ordered a 12 dollar call expiring jan 29th. It still needs time to execute. Good call or nah?Nice video. I'm not a retard like you guys but extra knowledge never hurt. And who knows, maybe in a year or two I'll have some side cash I can yolo on the next GME...$0.53 this morning. I sold them at $1.50. But then I decided to go back in with 5 1/22 12CIf you can guess the market right, and you're not getting screwed by the market, yes.  Absolutely.  Hands down, 1000%.\n\nBut on average you're not right.  You're going to get it wrong.  You will lose these calls.  Look at the loss porn.  Study them.  Those are calls.  If they bought shares and just held and moved on with their lives they'd be fine.\n\nThe honest most accurate call- and this is the most boring answer- is to have time in the market and to not to try to time the market.\n\nJust buy some shares in something you think works, or you have a hunch on, and forget about them till a few years later or when the market rallies on something and you think you need to make a move.   And just keep piling on new shares, market up or down.  It adds up.The option gives him the right (but not the obligation) to buy 100 shares for $15 each. That means that if the share price is $15.01 the option contract is worth 1 dollar, because he can buy the shares for $15.00 and sell them for 15.01 for a profit of 0.01 x 100 shares. At a share price of $16 the contract is worth 100 dollars. Basically, for every penny it\u2019s over 15, he makes a dollar.If the share price is $15 or below, the contract is worth 0 because its cheaper to buy the shares on the market than to buy them for $15 dollars each. He then is out the money he paid for the contract.\n\nAll these amounts are based on the share price at the day of expiration. If it hits the $15-mark before that it is worth more because of the time left componentThe short of it is; Most people sell the contract (particularly here) to someone else on the market just like you would sell a stock.  If the stock is worth more than the options are worth he /she makes a lot of money.  If not, the contract is worthless and he/she probably lost the contract fees and commission (typically they let the contract expire by the date listed).\n\nThe difference between the stock and the stock option is the stock has equity.  You get to keep the stock even if it falls in value and you can always sell at a later date.  The stock option becomes worthless after the expiration date, plus you pay a premium just to have it.  Stock options are risky, with huge pay offs if you can guess the market direction.\n\nThere are bigger plays to considered with options as well.  Such as exercising the stock option even if the stock option is below market value (maybe you think its going to be worth more in the near future?).   But this is something you need to consider with some legit due diligence because a lot of actual retardation gets floated around here.\n\nIf you want to throw some money in the pot, just buy a few shares.  Can't go wrong with building the equity.LMFAO. I\u2019ve been researching it\u2019s play money I promise. LFG BABY!!! I wanna make some greeeenIf you're worried watch it early tomorrow and see.

GME and BBBY it is.truuuuuee, Ride or Diejust try itWe won't know for sure until the January 31st when we get the report update. The recent surge is due more to Ryan Cohen stepping in with two others in my opinion. With the amount of shorts out there I think that the actual squeeze will be more drastic. I could be wrong though.Because the short volume is up, not down, so it hasn't started.They just gained $300 million today.  They can last out a few more months.  Realistically you only have until now people support ending lockdowns than enforcing them. Thats going to be within the next 2 months.Bless your heart.  I can but you shouldn\u2019tYes, but you have to tell them you know what you\u2019re doing. Someone on this thread explained the button steps to me since I couldn\u2019t figure it out some time back. In five weeks, I lost about 25%.  That being said, calls also made me about 20% today, so they are a fickle mistress.  I can\u2019t tell you the button presses to do it because I don\u2019t remember them.https://youtu.be/1Y3FzVQi-R8\n\nI\u2019m bold enough to gamble all of my money, but with the internets memory and growing databases, I\u2019m not bold enough to put the word in writing on a website.Oops, my mistakeCertified autist here. At the moment BB calls at a strike price are 1.13 for 10c expiring 1/29. Do I lose the 113 dollar premium when I sell it or is that part of the value?You can either exercise your call and buy those shares or (as most people on here do) sell the contract for a profitBecause in order to execute that option, you have to actually have the money to purchase those stocks, which most autistics retards here, do not, so they sell the option under the total value such that someone else will buy and exercise the contract.\n\nThe reason why you would want to buy options instead of stocks is that you can buy \"the right\" to buy a LOT more stocks vs if you just bought stocks in the first place, giving you a lot more return when you sell that option.Let me just give you a quick example. I bought my first option a couple weeks ago, a 1/29 $12c of Tilray for .38 premium (per share, so $38 total). A few days later Tilray was already over $12 and the option was worth >$100. I sold it, and basically got 150% return. However, that very same option is now trading for over $6.50 premium the last time I checked. That $500+ that I missed out on is the whole point of purchasing that option in the first place.\n\nThat's a simple example but I think shows how my intention was never to own 100 shares of Tilray, despite being bullish on it. I get to collect the rise in price for 100 shares for significantly less money than if I'd purchased 100 shares of Tilray at the time I bought that option when it was trading at about $9.50. Options can give you significantly more leverage, however are much riskier than shares at the same time. If Tilray had tanked, I would have lost my $38 if it expired worthless.Adding one thing here: \n\nThe further a call is from an expiration date, the more time value it has (eg. there's more time for the stock price to rise even more), which factors into the option price too.\n\nSo if your call has shot up in value, then waiting until expiration might lose you $ if the stock price plateaus, as there will be time value decay. \n\nI'm also rtrd when it comes to this but pretty sure this is trueSo that will breakeven at $12.10, so if you're thinking it will get to $12.10 by Jan 29, it's a good call! I would sell about a week or so before expiry if you're up on your position because each day you suffer theta decay (look this up).Start small. Remember with buying calls, the most you can lose is what you put in.Thanks. I'm learning a lot today and getting a good idea how these work. Is it normally better to sell the option once value increases, or exercise then sell the stocks?Thanks a lot for the reply, I didn\u2019t know much about options and this helped me get a grasp on it. So your option of $12.50 on Feb 12 is pretty solid since it\u2019s already at 9.40-ish, right?I'm new to this as well. I was wondering what happens if you sell an option without actually buying it first? Do you then essentially owe whoever bought the contract 100 shares if they exercise the option?Buy high, sell higher you'll still do okPreach. GL in the trenches brothe circle-jerk or BB?Isn't there an update tomorrow?Interesting. Appreciate the response\ud83d\udc99I didnt have much trouble with it, just clicked the button for \"some experience\" and it allowed me to lose money on the stock market in a whole new way!Heh thats rookie numbers i opened an options account last February. Had no clue what i was doing. Down 99% in a month or two. Climbing my way back upOh ok. Thank you btw for defining shares and calls. If I get started on the market I will probably just buy shares xDCertified dumbass here but I will try to help.\n\nFor an options contract you will need to pay the premium. In this case the BB calls are $113 for ONE contract which controls 100 shares.\n\nTMR if the premium rises to 1.23 from 1.13 (113 to 123) and you sell the contract you will get $123. Either way you lose the premium money. It's a matter of making enough money to cover the premium.I thought I read somewhere that Brokers will let you execute and sell instantly? What is the process/option for that? I just opened a TD Ameritrade a little while ago. Wouldn't that be fine by them, especially if they could charge a fee/commission?What stopped you from just waiting and executing? Was selling the option worth more than the 100x(price-12)? I'd figure you'd want to wait to be sure where the peak was and execute on the downslide, as long as it's still above what you spent on the stocks.I guess the math can favor the options selling within a certain risk margin. \n\n\"The option *has* to go up by X more before executing is worth more than the premium now, but if I wait and sell the option later after the stock plateaus, the premiums I'll get will be lower.\"\n\nThis is territory where I can understand the principal a lot faster than I can just do the math in my head. I'm guessing there are calculators or sites people use for this.Very rarely would you want to exercise the option in this case.  Usually people sell.   It\u2019s a more advanced long term play to consider exercising the option if you have the capital and the consideration for the equity appreciating long term - couple of years typically.Nah, it's actually super aggressive.  I'd aim for something more conservative if I did it again.  I mean, what on earth does BLACKBERRY have in store that justifies a near 30% gain in a month.  So 9.4-10ish is a good call.\n\n But the rest of my spreads in steel are doing fine so... \ud83d\ude80You sell the contract on the market to someone else.  That other person then exercises the options.  It's no longer you're issue to deal with.  Typically its a larger firm that's exercising the option to buy the stock.  But that's between them.If tits up just turn the screen upside down to red rocket to the moonyupPuts expire tomorrow I believeYou\u2019re welcome man. Ask around. I don\u2019t know much, but you learn to learn quickly around here with all the fear of missjng out on the rocket ships.Ohhh gotchu. So I just purchased 11c 1/29. So I\u2019d need BB (currently at 10.4) to rise to 11 to be in the money. Anything above that and I I\u2019d be on the moon? \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Just learning, wanted to lock in profits and weed stocks are very volatile, thought it could be a temporary bump rather than what it now appears to be, a stepping stone on the way to the moon. Obviously I am regretful now and feel like I've learned a valuable lesson, but hindsight is always 20/20 and profit is profit.> What stopped you from just waiting and executing?\n\nThe chance that the stock price drops.Ideally sure. But that's trying to time the market, and being risky instead of locking in profits.Awesome thank you!Thank you so much. So as long as I buy the option and then sell it on the market I can make my tendies and no longer have to worry about that contract again.Kek, too bad im still underage so i'm just doing virtual trading on etoro. So i'm with you guys xd (i just started yesterday)Essentially yeah. But you gotta remember that a contract declines in value every single day. I'm looking at the contract right now, and since its a new one if it increased to like 10.7 tomorrow you will already make some money.\n\nI wish you good luck my man! Make that shit print and kick your wife's bf out of your house.Correct.  Just sell it (most likely) or exercise it before the expiration.Honestly, I think everyone should do that to start and learn before time is up.Yea way too broke to exercise that shit. Cheers for the help.",

If I just listened to the autists I would have doubled my money on market orders alone.Hold strong, GME holders. Shorts were sweating at $25. Now at >$36 they're completely fucked.

House call if they dip below 35% and an immediate exchange call at 25% equity. They might be able to stretch it out but they will have to sell something to cover or bring in more trendies.I don't own any GME but these meme are something else\ud83d\ude02My favorite movie and scene of all time.yo i bought at 38 does that mean 0% for me then??GME gang welcomes every bagholder \ud83d\udcbcShould i go in with a leverage x2 maybe just to get as many shares as possible?Wait, is Melvin winning? What is going on? Retreat?We're all selling at open and using the gains for more PLTR?First of all it's Macedonians in English and Makedones in Greek(-lish). Makedonians doesn't exist.\n\nThey were considered savages by the Athenians just like the Athenians were considered boy lovers by the Spartans. City states weren't in the best of terms at the time and political rivalry between them doesn't change their ethnic composition. Theyre all descendants of the same tribes give or take, speak the same language and believe in the same cultural traditions.\n\nMoreover, Philip was actually from Argos.May I ask why are people doing this considering all the news around game stop and where the company is actually headingCan you make a part 2 of this meme where that paper hand cripple ass mf leads the Persians behind the Spartans? Cause that's going down rnIs someone gonna post the scene after this?Y\u2019all know how this movie ends right?I mean I like it but you do know how that movie ended right?Lol don\u2019t they all die in the end?I finally bought in.

Seems the whole point is to lead this sub off of cliffs. The short term gains are glorious but I can\u2019t see any future this stock doesn\u2019t crash after the artificial bubble pops. I like your style tho. That shit is cute.Can someone explain what happened here?

He told the tale1. You get a broker. Fund your account. If you're only using \"a few quid,\" then you'll want a discount broker like Robinhood. (Not sure what's available in the UK.)\n2. If you want to get involved in \"this sort of thing\" (i.e., what WSB does), just pick stocks you think will shoot up and buy some short-term call options. You need an options account to do that. Basically, you'll want to figure out how to calculate the leverage of positions you're considering (\\[delta \\* stock price\\] / call price). More is better if you think it will shoot up.\n3.

On top of that, yesterday was more of a \u201ccorrection\u201d than it was the fallout of us collectively fucking the Shorts. Stay in at least until then, and buy more shares if you can up until. \n\nAs far as PLTR goes, though...\n\n  NPR just this morning had a story about the biometrics the US Army has collected in nearly every encounter with a suspected/known insurgent. Fingerprints, DNA, known associations, all that shit.\n\nNow let me ask you: who do you think is managing all that data and doing the analytics for them, hmmmm? \n\nPLTR is an even longer play than GME, maybe even more profitable, but it won\u2019t be as sexy. We made history yesterday with GameStop. It\u2019s a wild success story, and you should be proud to be a part of it. Show that pride by buying more shares, and hold them until the Shorts are fucked into oblivion.

Do you own workShhhhh don\u2019t use that word it\u2019s just about memes rememberIt\u2019s a meme to buy GME, not manipulation jeez, that\u2019s boomer talk we millennials and Gen z up in this shitNo, this is using the rules of the game against the elite who used sketchy mechanisms to sell more of something than actually existed to screw over average investors.  They sold more GME shares than they could technically own.  One of ours saw a cheap company and is making something good out of it and we are in it because it makes more sense to us than the garbage reports Citron or Hindenberg put out.  Those guys are market manipulators.No.  \u201cSqueezing\u201d an over sold short actually brings the stock to a more fair market balance. \n\n\nSelling more shares of a company than the number of shares that exist is potentially manipulation and does not help the market come to a fair valuation.  \n\n\nThe argument is that they essentially diluted the fair market value by over selling the shares.  \n\n\nSo, it\u2019s a free market righting itself, by saying \u201coh if those are worth $x diluted, then when the dilution is removed they should be worth more\u201d.  It\u2019s math. It\u2019s free market.  \n\n\nTo stop that, or regulate buying over shorted stocks, would be diminishing the free market.  Which is the opposite goal of financial regulation.Its quite literally notStrictly speaking\n\nProbablySomeone said that Melvin Capital increased their short position[https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=GME&submit=Short+Quote%E2%84%A2](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=GME&submit=Short+Quote%E2%84%A2)  \n\n\napparently this is delayed 20 mins.

Although that battleship one slipped into one of my all time favorites.How long of a call do you recommend?Thanks for the information! How far out do you recommend I buy the call?Extremely, last I checked everyone was laughing at those who grasped to their GME stonksSo that your broker cannot lend your shares for shorting without your permission.

Us seeing an overextended fund, engaged with an even shadier insitutions behind them, capitalizing on them is not illegal.  That's savvy.\n\nWhen stated institutions are *naked short selling* shares that *don't exist*, sir, that is illegal.  Of course, its already been mathematically proven beyond a reasonable doubt that is exactly what they were doing, so, at that point, they squeezed the shit out of themselves.  *Of course* they were going to get long squeezed by the same autistic retards as well.  Why the hell not?  Those options were juicy as shit.  Unlike them, the people selling those calls *are covered by shares and/or cash*.  The callers don't have to borrow anything.  So you can see a scenario, where someone like me, whom sees a situation where I can literally make 10% return *of my entire portfolio* in two god damned days *with little to no risk* who has a fuckton of capital selling .  Well, you can see where those call sellers are coming from.  Besides the shorts pathetically to unload -20k puts in a way that doesn't get them prosecuted/bankrupt, you got us, the *savvy* ones gobbling up literal *tens of thousands of shares* to turnaround.\n\nThat all adds up to a squeeze.  That is simple market dynamics.  But, the important part, is *who was doing the illegal thing that led to perversion that led to this situation*.  That sir, is the insitutions who were naked short selling.  Feel free to report 'em to the SEC.  Most of us already did.... how dumb can a company be?  They are facing off against not only 1.8m autist, but also any trading firm that secretly watches us from the  shadows.So I think that means somebody was selling calls (another way to short a stock), but seemingly bought up the volume to close that position out (this demand spiked the price). Basically, it means the short squeeze if fully on because the shorts are starting to flip.Nvm, for some reason, Indians cannot invest in US derivatives. FML no tendies for me.\n\nI hope Dalal street is as wild as Wall Street.You will, because it's happening. \nGod i love i discovered gambling - Mondays are my favourite days. Sunday's could always go duck themselves (before and after i discovered \"investing\")Spread the word! Now there's at least two of us xDIt\u2019s up to you. Don\u2019t take financial advice from this sub.\n\nBasically the rule of thumb is not to invest money you can\u2019t stand to lose. Stocks are always safer because you can exit before things get really bad, aka you lose money but not all of it.Cannot give advice on timing. It depends on your own circumstances.IV is one of the metrics used to price options. GME IV is insanely high so premium is expensive. If IV comes down the premium will be much lower and you may not make gains even if the price moves in your favor.It means buy callsHey, on the plus side, that means you've survived ten years in this game. That's no mean feat!Not for longIt ends with their outcasts retard betraying them.[deleted]bruh the poetryAnd also as many shares as you can. The more shares we own the less shares melvin capital has to cover the more fucked they get.Buy shares and calls.

Which is not necessarily a lossNot that many new ratings thoughCut the cord and buy GME to holdGame stop is failing as a company. Currently there is a short squeeze on GME, meaning the stock is being bought by WSB and others in order to fuck over big short players, thus artificially raising the price of the stock.C\u2019mon!

No big deal it's gonna moon to day guys \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Dude you already know the answer common \ud83d\ude02 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Don\u2019t be a rainbow bear. Rainbow bears said that when GME was $10. Now they are sad pandas.brooooI own 1k shares at 10.50$Yes please for the love of god pick 1/22\n\n\nGives you more time for those gains\n\nI have a 11c 1/22 and 12.5c 1/22How many calls? Thinking of going in on this \ud83d\ude80What\u2019s the different between that and if I do $10c 3/19?Buy shares dude don't gambling for 1 dayOnly if you have the buying power to execute the contractDon\u2019t let them expire, sell them before then at profit.You make your profit based on the interest in the contract and how much time is left in it. You can still make a small profit without reaching the break even price if it starts to move up in a way that the contract becomes more valuable for it\u2019s strike price. Once you see what your max profit is like you want to sell to close before stock price and the contract price falls more. It\u2019s easy to miss ouut and for the contract to fall in price quickly but sometimes you gotta be patient too. To be honest I don\u2019t know shit about delta theta and all that other stuff but there are tools online that you can see how the contract is valued on a chart by searching the stock on the website.Depends on your broker... I know robinhood sells the contract for you if you don't have enough purchasing power.  \n\nBut it's usually it's a good idea to NOT let it expire and sell for profit a day beforeWait, let me ask your wifesame. i jumped in after a december DD, bought 1/15 9c and sold 2 days ago at -95%. I cant believe my timing.Same here for a loss. Feels bad. I still have a Jan 2022 15c I bought last month though.Profit is profit manNot just Sony. APPLE will use QNX for their car. LION, LI, NIO, XPENG all have QNX\n\nQualcomm partnership with QNX\n\nDon't sleep on thisPossibly $30 by EOW? Please let BB be the next GME. I have 50% of my portfolio on this stockI was reading $100+  ...was that realistic at allKeep holding \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Tried to look it up but couldn't find it. But ya I think wall St is finally becoming aware of this. Have a few 2022 calls luckily. Wish they were higher strike. Might roll them upDo I buy when the market opens or wait a lil?Fuck it gonna sell all my positions and yolo it \ud83d\ude80What\u2019s a good call?BROOOOHow long you planning to hold before selling?Thank you <32042 or 69So if the stock price drops below my set stock price I have to buy? Or do I just lose the premium paid?ok this makes sense i think thank u for helping a tardshes at her boyfriends house on weekdays good luck reaching herAnd what is this QNX you talking about? Am retarded.$30 by EOM. It will be the next GME if we use our collective will to make it so.EOW would be literally today.Depends if boomers realize the significance of blackberry being in damn near every EV. Unfortunately boomers always disappoint so I think $100 is overly optimistic.Just put in orders to sell everything at open \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80I have 12c 2/5\n\nEdit: probably going to buy more 12c 2/5 calls$10c 3/19I personally plan on holding a couple of months with the sort of news they have been dropping.  I think post-covid we are going to be seeing a real surge in EV related markets, especially with many places trying to push electric vehicles by certain years.I have no know idea. But I know exactly that it'll be \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 next couple months.No problem <3Gonna do 12 of 1/22 15c, wish I could do more lolDrops below the strike? Then it can\u2019t exerciseQNX is an Operating System designed by Blackberry that's geared towards Artificial intelligence. The main target is Autonomous vehicles (EV OR ICE doesn't matter). Every OEM is basically writing their own Autonomous driving program but none of them have a developed OS.\n\nBlackberry QNX is already in 175m cars and it will only rise with EV\n\nOnly other competition is Linux, which when it comes to safety regulations it will not passMisspelled, I meant to click M instead of W. I need to sleepfuck... well i\u2019m still hard either way \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Shit....i mainly do long term investment but I\u2019m going to ride the BB ship.Personally after this much of a gain, I wouldnt touch long options cause of IV. I have stocks and might sell some puts to open.Ok I think I understand. Will read more. Thank you \u2764Which cars already use this out of curiosity? I\u2019ve been sleeping on BB so all this is new to me.Linux isn\u2019t really one thing. That said, you\u2019re correct. The trend with shit products is to develop something running on internal Linux.\n\nThis is great and high quality IF you have high quality dev team AND SYSTEMS ENGINEERS to make sure that your underlying product is secure.\n\nWhat you end with most of the time? A product that has a hole somewhere in the underlying OS that no one is good enough to notice and patch. \n\nThe amount of IOT devices I see that are literally a shit app slapped onto a random Linux distro and slapped into thin plastic and no hardening is ridiculous. IOT Cameras with open telnet ports, IOT bondage devices that get hacked and peoples genitals literally held hostage by hackers ( google it lol ), it\u2019s crap.\n\nWhat QNX offers - from what I gather, I\u2019m far from in the loop on car tech - is an OS they can build off of that is secure instead of an app they slap together.\n\nSo it\u2019s not quite in competition with Linux, Linux isn\u2019t one monolithic thing. That said, yeah BB all the way.God damn it, all in it is!True true, I\u2019ll see what happens on market open. Also have my eyes on SENS.Def look into it. There\u2019s a lot of helpful articles or YouTube videos. For the Greeks focus on theta to start and then IV. It will help you understand WHY the contact is priced where it isXPENG uses it primarily so far I believe in their *Xpeng* P7.Yea I'm not a programmer so I only know as far as what I've researched. What I really meant to say is currently on the commercial sector there's no real competition to Blackberry QNX. I only listed Linux as a possible competitor just because I'm pretty sure tesla AP is built on it or Ubuntu. That being said when it comes to safety regulations and network security, BB will shine all the way since you can't regulate Linux programsYes Sir...thank you very muchSony's new car has it.\n\nApple car supposedly is partnering with Hyundai. Some are saying that's it's Canoo EV instead. Doesn't matter \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 both of those autonomous programs are built on QNX.\n\nNio partnered with Nvidia. Nvidia is partnered with Desay SV's Autonomous driving program with Li Auto. That program is built on QNX. Nvidia is also partnered with BB. Safe bet Nio will run DESAY on QNX\n\nLion EV QNX\n\nBaidu electric car? geely autonomous driving... Built on.... U guessed it.I agree entirely. I\u2019m really excited by what I\u2019m finding out about BBWas a huge Blackberry user back in the day so I'm really excited to see the comeback of a century",

As a non-native english speaker in america, my confidence in my command of the language went down like melvin capital's portfolio watching tenet. Good to know not even americans understand it lol.   \nWhy did I assume you were an english speaking american? cuz this is WSB and we confirm bias.That.... isn't even an option anymore is it?

If you didn't buy a call or a position already, keep your money out of it. \n\nI'm all for market disruption. Screw the funds that had puts hoping for misery and people losing their jobs. But now GME isn't going under anytime soon. They are well positioned for a pivot.\n\nWhen people lose money, I hope this sub finds a way to support the ones who don't know what they're doing and just lost a month's (or more) paycheck. \n\nBelief and faith have no business being in business decisions.Market and competition looked a lot different two consoles ago...\u30fd\u0f3c \u0e88\u0644\u035c\u0e88\u0f3d \uff89 Raise ur dongers!\n\n^^Dongers ^^Raised: ^^49166\n\n^^Check ^^Out ^^/r/AyyLmao2DongerBot ^^For ^^More ^^Infoword thanks bruv will do.Stock is up another 25+% since this advice lol.\n\nIt's certainly a gamble.

Pure majestic autism. \n\nI come out of Plato\u2019s cave to tell you I understand your pains. I was there not too long ago... you see... \n\nBack in November I noticed $BB cleanly up-trending on the hourly bouncing off the 9 and 26 MA (I use ichimoku) heading towards a resistance level that had already formed a double top \n\nLike a true Gamblers fallacy believing retard I made a wager: \n\n$10k into $6 calls expiring March on the DD that: \u201cwhat are the chances it falls AGAIN there\u201d ... that\u2019s it. \n\nA few days later AWS news came, and that $10k turned into $70k. Pure luck. Sometimes she goes, sometimes she doesn\u2019t. She went that day.\n\nIn that moment of seeing massive profits on AWS news day, I experienced violent and absolutely tremendous autism and thought, this thing is going from $5\u2019s to $15 in a single trading session, yes, even more retarded than you guys that bought the top on Friday \n\nSensible thoughts couldn\u2019t penetrate my helmet fast enough as drool gushed from my gaping mouth, gasping for oxygen and yelling at the top of my lungs what barely resembled words about Lambo\u2019s and Yachts... so I hurled about $100k into shares at $8.77 and about $10k more into $15 leaps \n\nI proceeded to watch my profit dwindle to nothing as earnings came and bent me over so hard I couldn\u2019t bring myself to watch the stock for a week \n\nI thought about selling the bottom, I was there, order ready typed, just needed to hit the send button, and I was going to close my position around $6.7ish and be back to break even after striking gold \n\nBut you know what, I remembered it\u2019s just money. I remembered that everything in reality is in flux, and changing, and decaying, and being born again, and to just flow with it and stop clinging and desiring one set of experiences over another (aka a fat bank account over giving $5 blowies behind a Wendy\u2019s) who cares? \n\nAll is well lads. So let go of the burden if you bought the top and are stressing, it\u2019s really fine. Look at what\u2019s happening right now:\n\n1) Insane volume, insane moves, erratic behavior (something is going on behind the curtain) \n\nPS: this movement and volume is NOT because of WSB, full stop. Big players are making huge moves here, and fast, we don\u2019t know why yet \n\n2) 1 Billion annual revenue \n\n3) Soon to come online a RECURRING AUTO DATA business that will drive revenue into growth cycle, BB is literally Microsoft Windows for cars but the auto sector was still underdeveloped technologically to benefit from this position, hence this vertical is finally about to print HUGE HUGE HUGE MEGA BILLIONS ANNUAL. This was always the plan and they just had to wait it out until the auto sector caught up with them digitally \n\n(The auto data tech sector is so lucrative it made Papa Elon the richest person in the world, and forced a fucking god damn phone company to join the race \ud83c\udf4e\u2014it\u2019s huge)\n\n4) UNDER, FUCKING, VALUED \n\n5) VERTICALS GALORE\n\n5) FB settled, imagine the BALLS on BB going after this massive and dirty tech behemoth run by a literal lizard, they are honest Canadians doing God\u2019s work \n\n6) IOT, AI, smart city\u2019s, insert other buzzwords \n\nI could go on and on, and honestly, I\u2019ve never felt more comfortable holding ANY stock than this \n\nMoral of the story: as I let go and accepted my circumstances and decided to diamond hand \ud83d\udc8e \ud83e\udd1a BB to the death, within a few days I proceeded to watch the fattest, thickest, randomest, greenest dildo penetrate my butt hole to the high heavens and take me from what was $70k profit to 0 profit back up to $130k profit. I\u2019ve trimmed half the options, I don\u2019t even know why tbh, reverse autism maybe, but I\u2019m riding my remaining calls and entire share position to Valhalla. \n\nWill likely add more if it dips. But...\n\nJust hold. Something is cooking on BB. You have to be a retard not to see it. Look at the fucking daily chart, look at the volume, the gaps, the swings, BB chart literally has Tourette\u2019s syndrome right now... \n\nThis stock has not moved like this for 10 years. \n\nIt might stall a little, deflate from here, consolidate a bit more, or it might blast off again any second. Point is, nobody knows when, but it looks like in a short time, we will know why this stock is moving the way it has. Something is DEFINITELY going on behind the scenes the public is not aware of and neither is the media \n\nFor fucks sake I found the court docs showing global settlement with FB is done 24 hours before gay ass Bloomberg even picked it up. The majority of the investor world still thinks they make fucking phones for Gods sake. Everyone is sleeping on this \n\nA note on Jim just in case he reads this:\n\nJim Cramer hates this stock because 1) BB and John Chen are not bootlicking CEO\u2019s jerking off CNBC and massaging Cramers asshole for air time, they\u2019re a tightly run, honorable company doing real things 2) He most likely became a bag holder during the epic fall of the BB phone and sold for a fat loss and wants to protect his ego by continuing to ignore the facts on the company\n\nThe guy wants you to invest in CRWD with a fucking ridiculous market cap, no verticals, and less revenue than BB. Promoting a literal bubble over a value play. What a bizarre world we live in. Take advantage of it, I hear this phrase all the time and I fucking hate it, but this is literally \u201cfree money\u201d \n\nKnow what you own. There is TRUE value in this company. No hype. Pure value. \n\nDiamond hand, double down, buy more, and just hold. You are in good hands \ud83d\ude4c\n\nTl;dr diamond hand $BB",

Eveything there is to find about this company is awesome, yet it's only at 5.5B market cap. \n\nThe volume is weird imo too, as well as us wsb'ers randomly picking it up roughly at the same time. I agree that this volume can't be us. There is however quite a probable explanation: BB came in the media a couple of times with positive news: Amazon partnership (huh wait what BB is in another industry than phones; EV's?!), Patent selling (huh wait what BB no longer sells phones?!), Facebook settlement (huh wait what BB no longer sells phones and has balls of steel?!)\n\nPeople are realising it's no longer the very good phone company that lost market share, it's now the very good company that does cybersecurity and is part of the EV supply chain.Already own 47 shares, will buy more if it dips again next week \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Bought 2/19 16c.

It's getting the attention from bigger players, finally. BB was trying to implement synergies with the Cylance acquisition. People are arguing the CEO has done nothing so far with Cylance. Whoever thinks you can successfully create synergies under 1-2 year without hiccups and burning through some cash is a retarded analyst. Plus the synergies are finally working out, and the hiccups are going away. This is primed for growth. Give it time and it will moon...

    "selfText": " I don't get what you guys are worried about with PLTR.\n\nHere's my **personal** DD on PLTR, you're welcome to read and do whatever you want. Other helpful info or pointing out mistakes in my DD is very welcome.\n\nFears preventing you from buying PLTR\n\n1. Targeted ads on your phone from Yahoo Finance or Zacks telling you PLTR = BAD!!!1!eleven\n2. Shills spamming \"pLtR tO tHe MoOn\" and :rocket: on PLTR thread comments.\n3. Last quarter's seemingly bad financials/earnings.\n4. Financials Moving Forwards\n5. Soros who owns 21 million shares \"threatening\" to sell his shares upon DPO expiry.\n6. DPO expiry 3 days after February's earnings and possible insiders and DPO holders sale and dip.\n7. What does PLTR tldr.\n8. Other Information\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***#1 Targeted Ads***\n\nAds and articles are both paid for by someone.The fact that in the past 3 weeks i've been getting multiple multiple targeted ads on my phone related to PLTR since i love PLTR so much.\n\nAds are telling me that PLTR is bad, doesn't provide a dividend, they're telling me PLTR's fair price is 20 instead of 25 based on some financial model and have gone as far as to provide a list of alternative stocks to buy.\n\nTo me, this all screams: **SCARE TACTICS**\n\nAdditionally, the last few weeks of ups and downs in PLTR's stock price is another indication of the attempts to short the stock to sh!t and drive investors out. (For what reason? I don't know.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***#2 Shilling PLTR***\n\nI myself love to shill PLTR to people whenever i can. I do this because i legitimately think this company will do great. I work as a product manager in a software development house and understand what PLTR does. PLTR is not cryptic.Regardless, i think when people shill PLTR to you, they are right to do so as you're probably missing out on a great opportunity to make money in the long run. If you're looking for big gains short term, maybe try something else.\n\nShillery is OK, but at least give the facts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***#3 Last Quarter's Bad Financials***\n\nIf you'd done your DD not by searching reddit posts but by checking PLTR's actual quarterly report, you'd know that PLTR's \"bad\" last financial quarter/earnings were due to the costs of listing themselves on the *New York Stock Exchange*.\\~855million were spent on listing and stock related compensations and this is the big reason.\n\n**Direct quote by PLTR here:** [https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx)\n\n>We incurred a loss from operations of $847.8 million, which includes $847.0 million in stock-based compensation following our recent direct listing.\n\nI would like to remind everyone that this is a **1 TIME THING.** Put simply, this means that PLTR won't have as excessive losses next quarter as they did this last quarter.\n\n*Additionally*, let me go into further detail on this and not just leave it to that.\n\n* ***PLTR's quarterly operating expenses for the past 3 quarters were at around \\~260 million.***\n* ***PLTR's operating expenses this quarter were \\~987 million.***\n\nADDITIONALLY...\n\nPLTR also had a higher R&D cost this quarter that just passed. Normally they'd pay 80 million on R&D, but somehow ended up paying \\~300 million this quarter. No one knows why, but this is another thing that influenced PLTR's earnings.\n\n[https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx)\n\n>On September 30, 2020, in connection with the Direct Listing, we incurred $769.5 million and $8.4 million of stock-based compensation using the accelerated attribution method related to the satisfaction of the performance-based vesting condition for RSUs and growth units, respectively, that had satisfied the service-based vesting condition as of such date.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***#4 PLTR financials moving forwards***\n\nPLTR is deep in bed with the government and the Biden regime although may look like it would be against using PLTR is in fact secretly very pro-surveillance e.g pro Palantir.\n\nHere's some of the known organizations in the US Govt that use PLTR:\n\n1. CDC\n2. Office of the Secretary\n3. Food and Drug Administration\n4. Immigration and Customs Enforcements / ICE\n5. Internal Revenue Service / IRS\n6. National Institute on Drug Abuse\n7. DOD/ARMY - ACC Aberdeen Proving Ground\n8. Coast Guard / DHS\n9. DOD/NAVY - Naval Information Warfare Systems Command\n10. US Attorney's Offices / DOJ\n11. US Special Operations Command / SPEC OPS\n\nBoys. The big institutional people know these things. You just found this out. See how deep PLTR is already in bed with the Government?????? Palantir IS the next Raytheon/Lockheed of DATA aggregation and visualization.\n\n***UPCOMING EARNINGS***\n\nI've done some quick maths and it looks like PLTR is more likely to be in positive earnings this quarter and with a 0.02 cent EPS target, we can easily assume that they'll destroy this with maybe 0.04 or 0.08 EPS. In the worst case scenario, PLTR's EPS this quarter could be somewhere around MINUS -0.05 ish due to interview costs and ad/campaigning costs that were not there before the company was listed.\n\n***WHAT CAN DESTROY PALANTIR***\n\nNow, there's big possible downsides and Palantir can fail IF contracts that expire are not renewed. That's biggest REAL reason for Palantir's balance sheet getting screwed.\n\nI've seen a disturbing pattern with PLTR's financials and that's that every year, it's R&D cost is rising by between 150 and 350 million dollars. This is quite a bit of negative revenue and if new contracts are not constantly coming in, PLTR's balance can start going into the negative.\n\n***WHAT WILL NOT DESTROY PALANTIR***\n\nSome people may have concerns over the new left leaning government dumping PLTR. An article was posted that is behind a paywall EVERYWHERE that goes something like this:\n\n[https://www.thedailybeast.com/cdc-officials-urge-biden-team-to-dump-palantirs-covid-tracker](https://www.thedailybeast.com/cdc-officials-urge-biden-team-to-dump-palantirs-covid-tracker)\n\nIn my opinion, i believe this is inconsequential and that a few people crying to daddy Biden to kill a multimillion contract with PLTR is a stretch. Also we know the current new Biden team has his hands full and will have them full for at least the next 1 year with what's going on.\n\nThere is no time to deal with a few crybabies and even if he did deal with it and did decide to kill the PLTR Tiberius Covid tracker contract with the CDC which he WONT, these things take months and years to deal with, and by then the contract/s will have already brought PLTR tons of money and revenue in.\n\n***HOW MUCH DOES KARP AND HIS GOONS GET PAID***\n\nShort answer is... A LOT. The amounts below are PER YEAR. That's a lot of money in the hole and contributes to annoying amount to why PLTR is always just at the edge of just barely being profitable.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ba58nqcurob61.png?width=2615&format=png&auto=webp&s=55d45833faad4d60ea8dc142a9601c44b4cc7395\n\nPalantir's prospectus 311 page document's 130 last pages are almost all exclusively talking about extremely complicated options trading schemes that are made by Cohen and others to make sure they can squeeze out a LOT of money out of PLTR.\n\nMithril Investments has existed from before and is not a new company. Owned by Thiel/Cohen/Karp as a way to launder and exchange options for more options and more money for all 3 of them. Also Shyam Sankar to me feels corrupt which scares me a bit, he's had some very shady dealings and has brought his wife in PLTR that gets paid 200k per year.\n\nProspectus Document: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm)\n\nI suggest you skim through it, it contains EVERYTHING about Palantir.\n\n**Palantir is going to need to have to be getting AT LEAST 500 million in NEW contracts per year to REMAIN BARELY profitable. It's doable in my opinion, but just barely and it's why they made the company public to try and get more people's attention and increase the inflow of contracts.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***#5 Soros and his 21 million shares***\n\nFirst of all, i think we can all agree that Soros can suck it.\n\nIf you've read a few articles here and there, you'll know that Soros owns/owned 1% of Class A PLTR shares. No one knows whether he's sold them yet or if he's an DPO holder who'll sell 3 days after February's earnings.\n\nWhether he sells them or buys more will be mostly inconsequential in my opinion. We see dips and pumps every day. He legally cannot sell his shares all at once, he'll have to sell certain amounts daily and over time. This will create annoying sideways motion as shares exchange hands and consolidation starts for 2-3 weeks until his and insider shares exchange hands.\n\nNothing special to see here, move along just a little draw down resulting in some consolidation.\n\nPLTR is exposed to OIL more than anything, so fluctuations in the general market and general market crashes affect PLTR much less than other stocks. Also PLTR does not track ANY benchmarks. NONE.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***#6 DPO expiry 3 days after earnings in February***\n\nTo my limited knowledge, this is how BIG plays who are holding DPO shares usually work:\n\n* If a stock has performed well up to earnings and investors are more than happy with the returns, they're more likely to not sell their stock or just sell less than they normally would.\n* If a stock hasn't performed as well as investors thought, these investors are more likely to sell stock or reduce their positions more than normal.\n\nThere's a total of 1.16Billion Class A PLTR shares currently (Give or take don't flog me). We are currently trading with \\~250 million shares while the rest are locked away in the DPO.\n\nWhen those shares are \"unlocked\" in February, the price of the stock won't be diluted. These shares already exist and are accounted for. They are simply locked. Also when they are unlocked, the share price won't simply multiply because all shares are now tradeable.\n\n>According to [Palantir\u2019s after-hours filing with the SEC this afternoon](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520257973/d89036dex991.htm), the company has 1.16 billion Class A shares, 484 million Class B shares and 1 million Class F shares on its cap table outstanding today, or a total of roughly 1.64 billion. Only Class A shares will trade, and Class B and F shares are convertible to Class A shares on a one-to-one basis. On a fully diluted basis, which Palantir says represents 2.2 billion shares total according to its most recent S-1 filing, the company is valued at $16 billion. The difference between those two aggregate numbers comes from outstanding stock performance grants, warrants and other financial instruments.\n\nWhat **WILL** affect stock price:\n\n* Employees exercising their non class A options into Class A shares. This IS dilution.\n* The bigwigs e.g Alex Karp, Peter Thiel and a few other bigshots exercising their options and then selling them for a profit.\n\n*To note, regular employees will barely affect the price of the stock with their miniscule share holdings. Alex Karp, Peter Thiel and a handful of other high ranked executives in PLTR are the ones that will create a tiny but manageable ripple in the stock price.*\n\nWhat **COULD** affect the stock price a lot:\n\n* Massive sell off by the big institutional holders.\n* Not shorters. (Citron and Citi can suck it, we're in control here)\n* People with weak spaghetti wet paper hands.\n* Everyone fomoing the same weeklies e.g like when everyone bought Jan 15 calls on everything.\n* Big but silent scare campaign (that's already going on) to scare off normies like us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***#7 What does PLTR do, tldr.***\n\nImagine Facebook's database of everything about everyone & Youtube's Database of everything & Geolocation data in a database made by the US Army for known terrorist cells.\n\nPalantir allows you to select and match varied data TYPES from several different database, combine it in any way you want and visualize it so that it's human readable by even the dumbest person in the room so that even they can see patterns and come to conclusion on a subject matter.\n\nIt's kind of like filling an excel sheet with data and then visualizing it with a bar chart, except the date you filled the sheet with can be anything and not just numbers or dates or countries and you can make various combinations using all the different rows of data to maybe come up with a pattern to something like how to best distribute the Covid vaccines in the counties in a very specific state in the US.\n\nLiterally what you see in SciFi movies where people combine random data by smashing keys on a keyboard and somehow find the murderer, the location of a terrorist or the percentage that someone will commit a murder in the future based on a lot of random data about that person or the area, country, family, history... anything.\n\nWhile this all might sound super cool and amazing, it is. Maybe in 10 years time there will be a few more companies doing this, but for now, it's only Palantir, Circles, Alteryx and a few other private entities that do this type of thing. Many of them work with governments and are hush hush due to the kinds of things they use this type of software for (terrorist cells, warzones, etc) and the public backlash this could cause.\n\ntldr: Glorified data aggregator and visualization platform/software with different access levels for different people.\n\n**PLTR is superbly positioned to offer their software to SLOW and Boomer like organizations like Governments.**\n\nGovernments are stupid and don't have neither the time, nor technical knowledge to develop this software themselves for internal use. This is what PLTR capitalizes on and why Governments use them so much.\n\nGovernments could have spent the a fraction of the money they spend on PLTR contracts to make the software themselves but only for their own internal systems and use, but they can't and if they tried, they'd fail because technocracy in governments is not a thing. By the time they'd even complete a project like this, it'd likely be out of spec, unusable and would require further development and money and we know how slow and bad governments are at doing even the basics. Again PLTR wins because of this.\n\n**PLTR is likely NOT** to be adopted by giants like Google or FB or other modern tech organizations of any size because they are not stupid. They have their own purpose built internal systems that they use to do everything related to data aggregation and visualization because they have the technical knowledge and resources. Buying PLTR for their use is a joke.\n\nPLTR capitalizes on being general a general purpose tool and is set up manually by an engineer over the course of 4-10 days for each customer. The engineer customizes and configures the system for each company's custom use since the software allows you to do so. Regular aggregation and visualization software CAN do the same, but typically lacks data input types and features that PLTR has because PLTR has cultivated a special set of features over many years that were suggested by their existing clientele in battlefields and other places.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***#8 Other Information***\n\n***\\*\\*Big known PLTR Holders\\*\\****\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a404oalxrob61.png?width=1631&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c2dbcfac5a7ca207127771ec4e3133f8d943359\n\n***\\*\\*PLTR's Price List (2019)\\*\\****\n\n[https://www.esi.mil/Download.aspx?id=7186](https://www.esi.mil/Download.aspx?id=7186)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\\*\\*Personal TA and Crayon Mania\\*\\****\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/chart/PLTR/nrjqL4dw-PLTR-Risky-April-100-200-possibility/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/PLTR/nrjqL4dw-PLTR-Risky-April-100-200-possibility/)\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/chart/PLTR/5YcdCye0-PLTR-Schizzo-Technical-Analysis/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/PLTR/5YcdCye0-PLTR-Schizzo-Technical-Analysis/)\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/chart/PLTR/CkCTvtqM-PLTR-PLTR-train-leaving-the-station-get-ready/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/PLTR/CkCTvtqM-PLTR-PLTR-train-leaving-the-station-get-ready/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\\*\\*PLTR stock pumping events\\*\\****\n\n* 7'th Jan - Interview\n* 26'th Jan - Demonstration\n* 11'th Feb - Earnings\n* \\~15'th Feb - DPO expiration - Havoc\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\\*\\*Similar Companies\\*\\****\n\n* PLTR - Palantir - Stock Price \\~$25 - Market Cap 48bln\n* AYX - Alteryx - Stock Price \\~$125 - Market Cap 8bln\n* Semantic Research - Private\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\\*\\*Known Contract Info\\*\\****\n\n* 240 million Palantir Air Force contract expiring soon in 3 months.

I'll be holding onto it for the next year. If it's not at least 300% by then, i'm selling it and moving on to the next stock. App i'm using is Revolut.\n\nAlso yes, i'm ALL-IN only on Palantir because i know my money will multiply itself in the short term. I'm not holding this till 2025 as others are supposedly doing. I'm selling in 2022 with 300% or more profit. PLTR is severely undervalued, underpriced because it's a DPO. Give it till EOY and we're going to be rich. If it was an IPO it'd be trading at 180+ already imho.\n\nI've spent the last month and a half holding PLTR. I've gone full schizzo mode when it comes to PLTR. I lose sleep daily and i love it. I hadn't slept for 37 hours a few days ago because i spent so much time researching PLTR and scraping the internet for all possible information.\n\nI come from an IT/Development background, so i understand what PLTR does completely.\n\nMy PT's for PLTR are:\n\n* 48-89 by March or April.\n* 75 - 125 by EOY.\n* 200+ 2022 IF they solve their income and constantly increasing R&D cost issues.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4t0k1ujprob61.png?width=407&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b3a16265edafa290432e6b79f9009e3df99f495",

Especially in a tech company. Napkin math time, you say normally 80m a quarter but 300m this time (so 540m tot) their current mkt cap is 1.9B so their PRR is 3.5. (PRR = MktCap/R&D exp) The lower the PRR the better. Generally 5 - 10 is the sweet spot, so 3.5 is a growth indicator. \n\nAlso, interestingly Discovery Capital Management has their fingers in it. Robert Citrone co-founded that Hedge Fund and is also the largest minority owner of the Steelers. Makes me wonder if PLTR has thought about licensing their software to the NFL (Think Moneyball guys). \n\nJust some thoughts and opinions. Good DD guy.I can read, and this is great DD. Thanks palRead everything and felt like selling. Wtf? \ud83c\udf11Diners, Drive-ins and Dives? I\u2019m in.29/1 $27.5 C loadedI read the vanity fair article that claims PLTR uses a lot of data anayalst who does the gritty nitty work of extracting the data for it to make sense and its not a lot of automation involved. Can we see if that is true by looking at an expense line? Basically what they are claiming is that as the data sets get bigger and more complex, PLTR is actually losing more money because they require more and more manpower and salary.Other similar companies:  \nIBM 114bn\n\nDatabricks 6bn\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPLTR by your EOY estimation has the same market value as IBM or higher. Over 10 times higher maketcap than more similar companies like Databricks(arguably waaaaay more successful, not IPO'd yet).Zero chance I'm reading any of that.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf11\ud83c\udf11\ud83c\udf11\ud83c\udf11Great DD.   Glad you didn\u2019t mention moon or post and rocket emojisIt\u2019s enough for me that AOC wants PLTR out of the intelligence community. Either she doesn\u2019t understand what they do or she does. Fuck that bitch. 7K shares, holding forever.Great post. Short term, could it be good to sell some before 15th Feb then buy back after?This was a great DD to start my weekend with, thank you. Bought in at $9.70 because Palantir will eventually be like the pre-cogs in Minority Report or project insight from Captain America Winter Soldier.Thanks for putting this together. I\u2019ve been in since it was $15 and keep adding more whenever I get the chance. The fact that Cathie picked this up in her ARK funds says a lot. \n\nAlso - Fuck AOCI\u2019m starting to get to the point where If people don\u2019t want to think for themselves (ie last quarters numbers were \u201cbad\u201d because stock based comp which is actually a non cash charge), then those people deserve to buy in near the top. \n\nPltr is going to easily 2-3x in next 12-18 months.Thank you for this. Miss the long winded DD posts. \n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80i like your words magic man, im in, ive always been inWow. I\u2019m a small pot of \u00a31k in at $26 and you are $250k. I hope we are both right!Thanks for the work mate.\nIn my opinion you have the choice between these options:\n1. Buy under 25 dollar\n2. Wait and buy after the earnings and the Soros storyThis is great great DD. My one question is how does the dual class stock play into stock valuation when common shareholders basically have no voting rights? I\u2019m all in on Palantir, but this is literally my only concern.Thank you! I tried explaining to my wife\u2019s boyfriend but he wouldn\u2019t read\n\n\ud83d\ude80PLTR to the moon!  In for 500 shares.You son of a bitch, I'm inWe buying the pump after 1/26 presentation? Positions?[deleted]Duck me I\u2019m not reading that2/19 27c checking in I bought at open yesterday down 20 percent already how we lookingGreat write up. Reading about PLTR's a rabbit hole kinda deal, I love it. To the moon  \ud83d\ude80Not enough  \ud83d\ude80 . \n\n1650 shares checking in.God, I wish I could read!Great read thanks.You have just convinced me to short PLTR around earnings time.This was really well thought out and good DD. I also strongly believe that Q1 earnings will surprise to the upside and will act as the first real catalyst for the stock. \n\nAnother thing to consider is the rise of domestic terrorism further fueling the govt's need for the types of data analytics PLTR specializes in.bought PLTR calls yesterday at the top. lets fucking go bois I AM NOT THROWING AWAY MY CALLS!Remind Me 60 daysThis was a detailed and informative read. Thank you for writing it up. These are the best types of posts in this subreddit.I\u2019m long some of the 50c 2023 and don\u2019t plan on selling this yearDid the coast guard renew their contract?Dude are u manic?Didn\u2019t I see this same exact post like a month ago?upvote for the great Revolut screenshot! and a shitload of money therean extra upvote for the all-in portfolio, masterclass!Thank you.  Learned a little I didn\u2019t already know.   My question is- if you are this confident, why not get the Jan\u201923 $50 calls?  They will DRAMATICALLY outperform the shares!RemindMe! 1 monthThank you for sharing. It's so important to understand this. Good job.\n\n\n\nTo the moon400 shares, similar plan.Remind me 6 monthsOne year timeline fair enoughYou are missing intelligence community as a customer.  Im sure there are deals that cannot be reported in the books.I'm holding PLTR too. How big realistically do you think their market cap could go? 48 Billion already at a stock price around $25, is it going to be a trillion dollar company? If so how?  \n\nAlso  \ud83d\ude80I'm in on PLTR and I think I'll up my stake next week. This company can only grow, with Thiel and Karp as founders/directors that is a green light to invest. \n\nQuestion on Revolut: what's your experience on their service and can you trade options?Thanks for sharing. I\u2019m a newer investor. I\u2019ve spent most of my time in ETFs and Index funds. \n\nI think the long term aspects of PLTR look good. Short term is questionable depending on lockout. They seem to be winning contracts and doing good business from what I can tell from\nmy full fledged retarded view. \n\nI bought 2.5K worth of PLTR stock this past Friday after hearing about it on this sub. Looking at available info on the google machine, I thought it was a good risk as the company is projected to start turning a profit and the lockout and earnings date will hold the price down. Once the lockout/earnings report plays out I think this stock has nowhere to go but up. Too many upsides. You have proven people, expanding niche market that has the chance to go big time tech. They seem to be winning contracts and doing good business from what I can tell.\n\nThis is my view as a full fledged autist of course. I hope to have \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c in the long term. \n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80#9. More gains in GME.Thank you for your service100% appreciate this, I\u2019m a small bag holder on PLTR. Unbiased advice here with both a good upside and some cons.Congratulations on not mentioning Biden or Russia one time.  \n\nPalantir is about to get relegated to the dustbin of history.  They have no moat.  They have no contracts.  These dudes are just cutting an enormous paycheck at your expense.\n\nThis is a murky investment and it won\u2019t get any clearer because that would only bring the stock down.  Some insider is going to buy a few million shares and you are going to just shit yourself with excitement.\n\nThe flat out truth is not only is Palantir garbage, but it\u2019s easier to make your money elsewhere in the market.  Short term it\u2019s lost its appeal.  And it\u2019s *definitely* easier to make long money than parking it in this retarded investment.I just wanted to add that despite all these hit pieces and downgrades, the short interest in pltr remains fairly low. If institutions are so bearish on pltr, why don\u2019t they short it? That\u2019s because they are waiting for lockup to expire so they can get cheap shares and they are trying to keep the price down before that.\nAlmost forgot: palantir to the moon \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nLink: https://www.google.com/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/article/4396504-palantir-shorts-are-missingThanks man, good DD. Have about 300 shares @ about 13. Will \ud83d\udc8e \ud83d\udd90 and add to them for years, for the reasons you\u2019ve stated. \n\nAlso, PLTR has stated that their mission is, in essence, to support Western ideals and democracies; they won\u2019t do business, e.g., with China. \n\nI wonder if that plays a role in the fearmongering about this great company (eg, if you\u2019re support PLTR, you\u2019re a racist/fascist/etc.)https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/09/inside-palantir-technologies-peter-thiel-alex-karp.htmlI'm 490 shares deep! To the moon brother!If the likes of Google and Facebook don't need it because they can develop their own, why does the US government need it? They love to hire contractors to build their own unique systems as opposed to buying a COTS solution like PLTR.Great DD, it aggregates all the public info on PLTR quite well. \n\nAlthough, I think an increase in R&D cost is a good thing for companies that are supposedly growing. Especially for a company who is currently trading at around ~40x P/E. \n\nAlso, can you elaborate on why you think PT will be 50+ by April and 100+ next year? They would need to significantly increase their earnings or they'd be around SNOW levels of overvaluation (100+x P/E).TL;DR; PltR $30 bY 12/31 oR I eAT mY LeFt TeSTicLe LiVe ON tWiTCh!\n\nYeah I'm still bitter.

Take my upvote.I think people also forget that the ancillary purpose of government contracting @ DoD is to fund the next generation of tech during the valley between \"innovative new idea\" and \"broadly viable on the commercial market\".  For new tech, the value of those government contracts is gargantuan. If PLTR figures their shit out (which is *the* bet, IMO) and becomes huge in corporate america...5 or 10 years out, 25 dollars/share will seem insanely undervalued.The author of that quote is a straight up dumbass and knows NOTHING about growing software companies. If R&D was not increasing, then I would be concerned because that means they have nothing new to sell to the market. \n\nDon\u2019t read Barron\u2019s, don\u2019t read seeking alpha, etc. do some independent thinking.They are, i'm just worried because i don't know what would cause you to have to increase R&D costs by 150-350 million dollars EXTRA per year compounding. I wish Karp would put my head to rest on this somehow.\n\nI hope it's real R&D cost and not money spent on a non optimized process that will simply bloat and grow forever...I too felt a large discrepancy between the overall read and the 10x in 1 year price target lolI would like an answer to this as well.why is databricks considered way more successful?You missed the \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80s in the commentsShe\u2019s a stupid bitchExplain for us retards?

If you paid a $3 premium then you need BB to reach $13 to at least break even. The cost of the contract is premium price x 100 so for my example that single contract would cost $300. Do some more research before you get into options because you can lose money fast and easy.[deleted]Yesget ready for 600Me after buying 80 shares of tlry at 8.60 and not knowing what a P/E ratio wasThere hasn\u2019t been a catalyst. They sold some patents, \u2018settled a lawsuit\u2019 with Facebook, and had some random presentation yesterday. I have no clue what it was about but it clearly didn\u2019t blow any minds because day ended red. \n\nLet\u2019s hope as this was an accidental buy. Placed the order Thursday night thinking I could get one in on everyone. Bit me in the ass. \n\nBetween this and my 2/19 $20c on the MJ ETF, I am all in.I will need to dig thru their SEC filings. Will update when I get any new InformationI'm just a professional idiot with only half an idea how options work. I'm slowly learning. I lucked into this call when I trusted a random stranger. Thank God I have 2 months to sort out what to do with it.\n\nBut I feel like the next time it says +$300, I should sell it.If you own the call contract, it\u2019s your option to exercise, not someone else\u2019s.thanks i appreciate the info..so why is it that when buying calls the lower the strike price like below the share price the more expensive the premium is?Physical Education rate, duh.Eh they were going green all week and ended green albeit minorly on a red day before a long weekend. I think next week it will correctAlright found it (somehow first thought that it\u2019d be announced coming May):\n$90 Million cash award if stock reaches $30 before November 2023\nSource: https://www.blackberry.com/content/dam/blackberry-com/Documents/pdf/financial-reports/governance/notice-information-circular-fiscal-2019.pdf see page 29\n\nThe 2020 proxy states that he\u2019s earned ~$130M from 2017-2019; hence it\u2019d be a nice boost for his retirement although he probably doesn\u2019t need it.talking about after i sellThat is because if the strike price is much lower than the current price of the stock, you have better chances of profiting or at least breaking even. Those contracts are called \u201cin the money\u201d. If the strike price is higher than the current price it\u2019s called \u201cout of the money\u201d. When it\u2019s out of the money you need to hope and count on the stock going up a ton more and therefore it\u2019s more risky so it\u2019s cheaper. There are a ton of things to consider which I can\u2019t go into depth here but I recommend checking YouTube for more explanation. Good luck!It\u2019s not pltr earnings????so lets say i buy a $12 Call for 6/18 for $BB for 10 contracts with premium of 2.41 totaling a Max Cost of $2410, at worse case scenario if i dont reach past the break even number 14.41 by the expiration date, the worse that can happen is i lose all of the $2410 right? i cant lose any more than that to a point where they'll take more money out from my bank or from my buying power? sorry for the retard questions i feel at home\ud83e\udd23thankss again \ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffcNo worries friend, the most you can lose is the premium that you paid for the contracts. Google options profit calculator and you can see what you stand to gain/lose at different dates in the future and at different share prices. It is quite useful.You have lot of patience....good man...Using a googled calculator, my \"entry cost\" = \"premium-or-price per option\" x 100?  That is the cost to \"get in\" and if I choose not to exercise by the expiration date, I only lose that amount, correct?\n\nIf one has strong conviction a stock will go up 100% in 2 months and the cost to get in is only $170, it seems like a no brainer (I know, nothing is guaranteed)to use BB as an example (i'm completely inventing these numbers):\n\nsay BB is at $10, and you buy a call option for $3.50 with a march expiration date. you will pay $350 (3.50x100) for that. That gives you the right, but not obligation, to buy 100 shares of BB for $10/each on or before March of this year.\n\nIf the share price is below $10 it's utterly worthless, and if it's below $13.50 it's not worthless but still you lost money on the deal overall. When buying this call, the max you can lose is the $350 you paid for it.\n\nIf BB is at $20 in march, the call will theoretically be worth $10 (the difference between 10 and 20 is 10, x100=$1000). Thus you've turned your initial $350 into $1000. Pretty cool. But, if it's worth $9, you get nothing. If it's worth $12, it's worth $2 (aka $200), which means you didn't completely go bust but still lost $150 on the deal.\n\nIn this last case (it's $12 in March) spending $1000 on shares would have netted you a 20% return, whereas by buying a call you lost $150. As with everything in the financial world, there's a risk/reward at play - options are greater risk with greater reward.\n\nAlso be very cautious anytime you feel yourself having \"strong conviction\\[s\\] that a stock will go up 100% in 2 months\", as those generally tend not to play out. I hope it does, and if it did, owning a call option would be a great play. But if you're not experienced in trading options, please go easy until you understand your risk tolerance and how much you can afford to lose, because sometimes you'll hit big and all is right with the world, other times you lose it all and spiral into a void of self-loathing.

It's been unreceptive to other good news. I can see high 7s or low 8s. Low 9 is still a good time to buy because it will definitely go up again next time they announce a partnership. The actual products wont come to fruition until later this year imo and it's a good long term buy if you get in low enough. Anything over 9 is paying too much right now.\u201cBB iS a bOoMEr pRoDUcT\u201d  get off Reddit and do your research homie. Theyre about to be heavily invested in the EV market and looking to integrate their technology by partnering with Amazon. They want to monopolize their technology inside the automotive industry.It's not the same product my guy. They no longer sell phones.You have no idea what a short squeeze is if you think 100% is a lot. Like absolutely no idea.You clearly don\u2019t know what squeeze meansAnd you may be right. I kept looking at the chart from the past month or so and it seems to be consolidating nicely creating a new low and then pushing the wall for a low vertical progression. I\u2019m hoping it lands around $9.00 but may drop below. I have my hands in at $9.65 and excited to hold and see what\u2019s happens with new news.They are already in the top 19 out of 25 EV makers and make up for 61% of the EV markets software. They have already began the monopolization and are succeeding more and more, and now they even got the Sony deal. More and more to come I think.They no longer cell phonesAs they restricted margin rates \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02ur good bro, carry onI first got in at 8.40 dec 1st and cost averaged down. If you can, do the same and keep buying it up when it drops lower. It really is a good stock in the long run. Dont paper hands and you'll get your profit eventually. It will probably even rocket later this year. Just wait till you can make a few bucks per share and dont get greedy. Maybe set a trailing stop loss after it goes to 10. You'll be okay but it might take a month or 2. They keep announcing partnerships so just hold strong and you wont lose.\n\nEdit:eh you're still in the green so you're not even in a bad place. Everything else applies.Better ingredients \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 better Berry \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 Papa BB \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Nope.

    "title": "$SRNE to the moon (again) \ud83d\ude80",
    "selfText": "First-time poster here, but I've been lurking since about September. Y'all brought me tendies in the form of GME and PLTR plays in the past couple months, so I thought it was my turn to repay the favor with some DD on a company that I haven't seen posted about on here yet. This isn\u2019t a short-squeeze opportunity or an ARK darling that\u2019s up 100% in the past year. The play here is Sorrento Therapeutics ($SRNE). SRNE is a biotech company which specializes in researching the use of stem-cells for cancer treatments, as well as non-opiod pain relief treatments. However, if you recognize the name, its more likely due to their developing pipeline of COVID-19 offerings. Since the outbreak began in March, SRNE has applied their resources and existing competencies to developing treatments and testing kits to combat the pandemic. In addition to their ongoing cancer and pain relief projects, they have 11 potential COVID-19 related products in various stages of the pipeline. You can view everything that they are working on here:\n\n[https://sorrentotherapeutics.com/research/pipeline/](https://sorrentotherapeutics.com/research/pipeline/)\n\nEssentially, this company is working on projects to combat cancer, the opioid epidemic, and, oh yeah the global pandemic that has dominated the planet for almost a year now. There is massive demand in all of these areas for new solutions, and Sorrento could be one of the organizations that solves part of the problem. \n\nNeedless to say, SRNE has a lot going on in its labs at the moment. However, each one of these projects represents a potential catalyst for the stock price. For example, the stock jumped almost 200% on May 15th when the company announced that one of their antibody treatments was 100% effective in inhibiting the virus in early testing. (I was holding 450 shares @ 3.15 that I had purchased purely out of excitement for their cancer and pain relief work. I was more than happy to dump them at $10.2 during pre-market on May 18th \ud83d\ude0c)\n\n[https://investors.sorrentotherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/sti-1499-potent-anti-sars-cov-2-antibody-demonstrates-ability](https://investors.sorrentotherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/sti-1499-potent-anti-sars-cov-2-antibody-demonstrates-ability)\n\nThen in August, the share price climbed to a peak of $20, apparently on pure speculation. These two examples demonstrate that this stock has a ton of interest in any news or releases on the COVID front, which arguably isn\u2019t even its main business. The share price has been volatile since August, moving within the $5-12 range over the past 5 months.\n\n**The reason I am writing this post now** is because the stock is up about 20% today, again with no news as of this posting. On December 22nd, the company filed an application for an Emergency Use Authorization for their rapid-test product with the FDA. This is where I think the real money is there to be made. They missed the boat on the vaccine race, but there is still a huge need for improved testing, which in the past has been inefficient and inaccurate. SRNE\u2019s COVI-STIX can reportedly deliver results in 2-15 minutes. With widespread availability of this testing, we could even get back to sporting events and concerts, as testing could be done quickly at the gates of the arena, and any positive cases would be turned away and refunded. SRNE is also working on a rapid spit-test, which would eliminate the need to have a q-tip rammed into your brain.\n\nNews on the potential approval of COVI-STIX is imminent, which could further send the stock price higher in the short-term. 20% would only be the first step on this moon mission, as no real news has even been released yet. It's also possible that the jump we saw today could be pure speculation and the price will fall back into the $7-8 range next week and stay there until actual news is released. I'm not saying buy or don't buy right now, but I wanted to get this DD out here before the stock really moons. Just wanted to give everyone a chance to read into this company over the long weekend.\n\nRegardless of this short-term spike, the play here is the sheer number of possible catalysts in their pipeline at the moment. The stock currently trades at a $2.6B market cap, which leaves room for a huge move upwards. The company has increased their cash while lowering debt in the last year, meaning they should be in no danger of going under in the near term. They generated $28M in revenue in the first 9 months of 2020 from their one existing product, and this revenue could double if they get any of their new products approved.\n\nSRNE closed at $9.50 today, but the **average 1-yr estimate on this company is $25**, which in my view is completely attainable if any of their products attain FDA approval and make it to the market.\n\nIf you're looking for any other reasons to get on the SRNE train, the company has a CEO in Dr. Henry Ji who publicly hates shorts as much as we all do.\n\n*\"I am giving them a fair warning shot. Just cover yourself, don't ruin your family,\" Ji said of short sellers who he says are trying to manipulate Sorrento's stock.*\n\n[https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/08/26/sorrento-therapeutics-opened-up-117-after-ceo-slam/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/08/26/sorrento-therapeutics-opened-up-117-after-ceo-slam/)\n\n(Seriously, with the amount of hype around this stock, it takes almost nothing to move it double-digit percentage points)\n\nEven after this declaration back in August, there are still 68M shares sold short as of 12/31/20. It's not GME level short interest, but it would accelerate the rockets if any big approval news is released.\n\n[https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/srne/short-interest](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/srne/short-interest)\n\nI'm not as experienced with options trading as most of you are, but if you want to buy calls I would buy them at least a few months out. The news that could send this stock up 100% is likely imminent, but it will be impossible to predict its timing since we are dealing with FDA approval here. It could be next week, it could be in March. My guess is as good as yours. I wouldn't buy any weeklies or FD's and expect to hit it big. If you like what you read here, take some of your GME profits and buy a few shares and hold on till this baby hits $20+\n\nAs always, do your own research into the stock before throwing your money at it.\n\n**Positions:** Too dumb for options so I'm holding 500 boomer shares at $7.21.\n\n**TLDR:** Biotech company with over a dozen potential COVID/Cancer/Pain Relief products in various stages of FDA approval process. Potential EUA approval for rapid COVID testing product sometime in the next month = \ud83d\ude80. CEO hates shorts. Buy shares or longer-term options to ensure that you are holding when any news hits.\n\nObligatory \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 for good luck",

I felt bad posting DD about a stock after a big move had already happened, but I figured a lot of people on here saw the move and I thought it would be good to illustrate that it still has some juice in it for the future.\n\nGood luck to you as well!Yeah that's my bad, there's not a big biotech presence on WSB so I wanted to post about SRNE earlier but I kept putting it off because I figured it would be stuck between $7-8 for a little while longer. I was actually waiting for it to come back down to accumulate a few more shares closer to my avg. Then this move today caught me off guard since no news has been released to justify it. But like I said, if any of their products get approved, this 20% move would only be the beginning. \n\nDefinitely do your own research on this one. Like you said, I expect it to be pretty volatile in the near-term until news is released, whether good or bad. In my personal opinion I don't see it going below 7 without news, but again, that's just a feeling from watching this stock since Dec. 2019.\n\nGood luck to you, I hope this moons for both of our sake!!I intend to buy $500 worth of FD\u2019s in this until March... assuming positive news breaks, ROI should be \ud83d\ude80",

At its current state, 80+ per share is justifiable. With a transition to effective e-commerce and Chewy methodology and customer service, it can easily be worth 400+.Why not both?  I\u2019m in love with it, and trying to trade it to the fucking moon.(It\u2019s like watching Zeus come down as a mortal to mingle with humans, and nobody recognizes him...)If they sold at 36, they collectively held less than 80k shares.\n\n\n\nThose have been bought, and then some. \n\n\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Thanks for the confirmation buoysSame!He should run. Theres 4 board members leaving, and cohen will be taking 3 of those seats. WSB could easily push for that 4th seat if Ryan doesnt have someone in mind for it.\n\nedit: u/deepfuckingvalue tagging in case he's interested or hasnt considered it yet.They sold on 1/13, good riddance[https://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/1326380.htm](https://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/1326380.htm)Do you know what a Form 4 is?Puts arent covered by shares. They are contracts for the right to sell shares at a certain price. So I sold someone else the right to sell me 2500 shares at $20 by january of next year. If GME stays above that, those contracts expire worthless.When you sell puts, cash collateral gets withheld from you. A $20 strike would be $2000 in collateral. If they expire worthless, you keep all the premium cost. If they get exercised, you lose all the collateral and get 100 shares. If this happens, you still keep the premium which means that you technically bought the shares at a lower cost basis than $20.I would hire them in a second. Took a company left for dead and look where we are now\n\n\ud83d\ude0e \ud83c\udf7aI\u2019m like to say they were trying a spite move to drop a ton of shares and screw the price like it was them being fired that led to a crash.  Backfired in true justiceSame here, I'm in with a lot of shares, will probably take out some, if this squeeze really moons to 200+, but GME will definetly stay as my largest position afterwards so Ryan can work his magicWhat do you foresee Cohen doing to save the company?Same I like GameStopI wonder if Ryan didn\u2019t tweet this week just so he wouldn\u2019t pump up share price even more for these 3 boomer losers.\n\nAnd for anyone reading this that still isn\u2019t following Ryan Cohen on Twitter do yourself a favor and follow him now with notifications turned on. The next time he tweets we will be mooning even more wildly than this week.Thanks for the confirmation boysWe must pool all shares into one accountDuh, it's that thing my wife does with her bf but won't with me right?Can wait 2 days to file after selling I thought? Just wanted to know if they sold todayIm in Canada and in our tax free savings accounts we are allowed to sell covered calls but not naked calls\n\nJust wondering if it was the same with puts in regards to being \u201ccovered\u201d but guess I\u2019ll try selling naked puts Tuesday and see if it lets meAh okay so it just lowers my buying power (if I can sell them) thank you!reducing unprofitable retail footprint, expanding and streamlining their online presence, capitalizing on esports, utilizing the MONSTROUS amount of historical gamer purchase data they possess to improve and capitalize on the gaming experience, additional profit sharing deals with Nintendo (former president of Nintendo america is on the board), then sony...\n\nThe sky is really the limit.I\u2019m a total noob here with a small time yolo stake, but \u201cInvest in what you know.\u201d Saw a 309% increase in online sales as a start of really looking deeper. Beyond that, I know nothing lol.\n\nI see an incredible opportunity for physical e-sports locations, VR opportunities and if I\u2019m being honest the kid in me just wants his dream of a place to visit and buy the newest haptic suit and Omni-directional treadmill. If they managed to buy out or rent struggling theatres to display on large screens or just get more space in dead malls to increase floor space after the pandemic is over and people want to get the fuck out of the house this is a growing industry that can pounce on that cheap space.\n\nBought the slump, hope to increase during the squeeze. A man can dream.What needs saving?Maybe a deal with Sony for a cut of their profits from games.That\u2019s anal.no that's called sexIf you read the Form 4 it tells you the date and price for each transactionDon't trade options in your tfsa account, just open a margin  account so you don't throw away away your contribution roomSelling naked puts is fucking retarded. Make sure you have enough cash to cover the purchase if the puts are assigned. BTW, there is suck a thing as a covered put. It's when you short the stock and then sell puts against your short position.You can't sell any type of put in a tfsa. Can only purchase calls and sell covered callsthis guy fucksIf gamestop can use its data to have the right volume on releases and be branded as \"never out of stock\" on popular items, while successfuly avoiding warehouses full of junk, they could EASILY get my business.\n\nAdd third party exclusive partnership like limitedrungames.com and a bonus sub for twitch each month and they go head to head with amazon. \n\n\ud83d\ude80 My GME fanfic \ud83d\ude80Physical esports....\n\nSo teams of people going to gamestop to use huge projector screens to play madden against each other? Stuff like that?You had me at retardeddisappointed but not surprisedThink giant arcade for all the poors with no internet cuz we keep getting screwed by the ISPs, plus marketplace / test arena for all the best VR gear. That\u2019s short term in their stores. The theatre would only work if there turns out to really be enough of an esports market to create teams competing with supporters in the seats behind them.But that sounds like it would be easy more expensive than home internet. \n\nI could see that possibly taking off,  just not for that reason.Sorry, further clarifiedWhat you are thinking of is a gaming internet cafeWhat I\u2019m thinking of is a physical location to try, buy, trade and upgrade the latest in VR tech as it evolves. I\u2019m betting every kid is going to grow through haptics like crazy and need to trade them out for new ones that fit or the latest model. It\u2019s the kid in me dreaming, but whatever.",

If this deal falls through its going to at least $100. Some heads are calling it to jump to $125ish after next earnings. Just needs to get to their next earnings call. It will jump to $85-90 alone after this deal falls through next week for them to sell Cohen's PV firm.there is high upside (the tender falls through) and low downside (the tender clears at $75.25).Tender offer at 77.25 currently while the stock is trading $2 over that in spite of the down pull from it. Stock should be at least trading 85-90 at this point. Earnings will showThat's a pretty wide bid/ask with shit volume so I'm probably out. Good luck though. hope you catch a big run \ud83d\udc4dI'll keep it in my watch list, thanks!there is only one more trading day to play the tender.oh interesting... guess I'll take a position if possible on Tuesday, if not then next time!",

But in general, as close to atm during lowest iv and longest time frame for movement, within my budget, is what I look for in plays.15 a year outthey were going to expire, leaving any potential gains on the table anytime after 1/15. adversely potentially paying off though by taking advantage of strike price rather than paid off premium gainsI\u2019m just happy we can get in on this one before it takes off.

    "selfText": "Let\u2019s face it, most of us missed gme. Of course gme will hit $500/share end of year, but for all other semi-retarded autist, lemme tell you why you should be buying $bbby right now before close. \n\n- Very well regarded Mark Tritton (former Target CMO) became a CEO just over a year ago. He\u2019s the only the 3rd CEO and 1st outsider in the company\u2019s history who\u2019s very optimistic about a turnaround\n\n- they\u2019ve sold non-core assets and expect to raise additional $350mm-$450mm in cash from non-core that will be pushed towards digital sales\n\n- Digital Comps up 94% YoY. Penetration online continues to grow drastically with a 31% annual growth rate\n\n- More digital means wider margins. Gross Margins increased from 32.2% to 35.4% which simply means they make 3% more on every sale which is huge. \n\n- They\u2019ve increased the planned share buy-back from $675mm to $825mm in the next 3 years. That\u2019s 1/3 of the fucking float which signals the confidence of the management \n\n- Haters might point Net income was negative. True, but it was mainly due to $2.469 billion NON recurring  restructuring cost. If we omit that cost, the net income over the past three years is +$500mm. \n\n- EV/EBITDA is 10.01 vs conservative 12.7 industry average at the time of this post. So that alone should put us at a fair value of $35/share today. Based on forward EBITDA for 2021, that\u2019s $39/share in the next 12 months. And that\u2019s not accounting for share buyback.\n\n\nSounds good right. But wait, there\u2019s more\n\n\n-BBBY is the 5th most shorted stock over $1 billion MC with 68% of short float. You all know #1, the other 3 are garbage. Just like u/runrun8 pointed, Michael Burry is in, and YES, the fucking Melvin has the audacity to short this one too. \n\n-Our king retard Cramer is pushing it (by frequently interviewing the CEO and explicitly saying that $BBBY is the next squeeze)\n\nTLDR: 2000 shares + May 2021 $30 Calls \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 (Second time in my life I go ALL IN.

But I got a couple of 9c on 1/29 that need to at least break even at $10.Drop $4000? Did you lose money on $BB?same I should have just sold but I am learning the value of diamond hands in this sub. It works.I was just joking, the techniques for moneyball come from money (hence the name), it would be redundantWhatsApp being dirty with terms and conditions, we'll all be back on blackberry messenger soon enough. Heard it here first.Yeah I missed out on GME and went balls deep into BB.What did you guys buy calls a week out? Do longer term calls in the future, less risk and you still can get a nice payday on big moves, not as much obviously, but still. Hell, I\u2019m not even in calls, I\u2019m just long the stock, but that\u2019s also cause it\u2019s an investment for me, not a trade.I was up $4500 on BB 1/29 calls and now I\u2019m only up $1000ImpossibleSomeone doesn't follow daddy Elon. Use signalI'm 20 deep on game and grabbed 22 BB today. Starting slow but I'm having a ton of fun.

Not so dumb now huhHopefully it flys to the moon \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80I mean I bought stock at $9.13 so I'm still up right now. I'm holding at least another couple weeks, no worries here. \n\nI'm just letting this guy know 10.25 isn't the bottom. This is still reddit, I'm gonna jump at the opportunity to tell someone they're wrong.Same...Same exact boat... :/Same, I\u2019m in at $7.52 and holding. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re anywhere near done. The market cap is still small enough for us to have an effect.We can do it!  I didn't sell BB $9c 1/22 this morning when it was up 3,200% from when I bought it, because I BELIEVE IN NEXT WEEKI bought in at $8.11 and holding. I think this has some runway. Let's fucking hope.",

Bullshit, that's why.\n\nDon't they just make shitty phones? No you retard, they're a software company now and they also happen to make shitty super secure phones for government/high ranking officials.\n\nIt's already soared, is it too late to join? If we aren't at 40 yet, it's okay to buy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis thing has traded sideways for the last decade and it reminds me of AMD. New buyers, all shorts in the past 5 years who are still short are all in the red. Just blew through 52 week high.

No longer a phone company and getting serious by selling a bunch of their phone patents to Huawei. Blackberry is EV focused and ready to expand with more partnerships. The partnership with Amazon is just icing on the cake. I believe in you Blackberry!Do we think it\u2019ll dip at market open? Pre market is looking high rn, not sure when to buy injust loaded 50 shares, fuck it lets see if this is the next gamestopAll DD should be written like this!

I know it's nothing like the gains some people see, but for my first call I'm pretty happy.P/S doesn\u2019t indicate how much discounted cash flow the company will bring in. Ford trades at a third of its sales for example, but that\u2019s because they make so little on their sales. BB didn\u2019t make any money in 2020 and the price is 50x 2019 earningsFirst time acting on a WSB advice. Started with $230 last year and just hit 1k today (thanks biotech penny stocks).\n\nGot 30 $BB shares and I'm happy to finally be a part of the community.

I was watching them through December, and now have opened a small CSP at $9 for next week, genuinely hoping it falls to that level as it's bang-on the standard dev from the 10 days.

Might run for a while due to being so low.Placed an order for 7500 shares at openNo one is selling my $15c 2/5 :(I bought 250 shares at around $7 just before the Amazon IVY pump. \n\nI sold after the earnings, as outlook was very disappointing. Honestly, the business is operating at a big loss and they've been in the automotive business for years now.\n\nThe news with Sony and Huawei are promising, but keep in mind that the first IVY vehicles will be on the road in mid 2023, this is a very long play, and that is IF they actually pull off good unit economics for software revenue. So far, most of their revenue comes from IP licensing, which isn't a very strong growth point.\n\nI probably should have kept my shares in all honestly, feeling a bit salty and FOMOing too here, but it's already up 200% almost since a few weeks ago. The market is pricing these things in.\n\nBe careful, when the Berry burns you, it burns you bad and it hurts :(\n\nGodspeed though, all the best!BB long which strike? open?Well for me it's either my attention goes to calls or my job as SW engineer... But definitely stocking up on shares as wellYep, Made $3500 but this morning could have sold for $17.5k. It's a strange and lame feeling to be upset when you made $3500 in 1 day, but it happens when you see what you could have had...not my first time.Still buying at open?   Are there still tendies left in this.\n\n:Edit:Realistically won\u2019t think fall below $15 again soon before it goes back up? I imagine a lot of people are treating this as a PnD and shorting tonight rather than a long holdThanks! Been a long time lurker here so finally felt like I should join the forces! Hope you see nothing but green come your way fellow soldierIdk how to value crowdstrike I don\u2019t really understand it like some others in the internet space wouldLike my bid/option price or the price of BB will drop below 10?Yea if I load today I'll probably end up being 9ish EOD.\n\nDon't forget CEO john has bonus vesting up to $125mil if the stock hits $30. \n\nHe gets half ish at $16. \n\nEven if u load now it's free 50% gains are current pricesThis just in, ride it to 1000is there much of a difference between the two for potential jumps??right on - thanks brethren. Affirmation received. \n\n \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80  see you on the moon.Tnx mate so its something ti not worry abouton one hand yes this is paying off... but on the other hand if you  make these reckless trades all the time it's not probably not gonna be very profitable lolOh I will. I even bought more at the dip after that lol. I mean what is a dollar difference in entry fee when we are going to the moonidk if its big dick, but im putting in about 6kSweet thanks a lot bro here have a silverYou trying to be the deepfuckingvalue of BB?

GME to the moon! Bb takes backseatI'm in shares.I'm working on learning to not look at what could have been, and instead be happy with having a good exit strategy and making money. If I play the woulda coulda game, eventually I know I will get burned..Going to buy some PM and then throughout the day.It wouldn't be a PnD if it is undervalued. It's headed to tendie town. If anything the 7% of shorts will probably start to cover as they're getting new deals.Well BB is def gonna go up not down and when it goes up the premium will go up so your total contract price will go up hence it won\u2019t fill. No one gonna sell you a cheap option when the price keeps mooning \ud83d\ude80I mean it depends how much you borrow lolExactly. I'm maxed out now.I mean, if you're trying to save 60 bucks and play it perfect sure, but you could miss out on upside doing that. Or buy in chunks.thank you sir... We all need to help each other out... I am glad to do my part...Up to 45k shares. 15k of those are on margin.Then who is?Hope you're hungry.I\u2019m on this ride baby to the moooooon fellow retards47 shares in let\u2019s ride \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80is there much of a difference between the two for potential jumps??  \n\n\nI;m in NYSE fully and worried I made the wrong move.IM NYSE \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15\ud83c\udf15\ud83c\udf15tsx please :)Shares...Who does this guy think he is giving us sad newsPapa Buffet said it best.\n\nIf you hear counter arguements to your thesis and you get mad, you are gambling.Buying right at open or waiting for dip?Totally.Its heading to ATH despite being a disappointing adventure of a company trying to find a way to market a product and make money. Not sure how you call it undervalued unless you zoom out to when they were the best cellphone manufacturer over a decade ago.Well aren\u2019t the sell options already on the market for sale? I\u2019m confused. The 9.5 option is at .39Don't worry i got fucked \ud83d\ude10Well since they make software for cars and phones and not data analytics or cybersecurity I'll let you decide...Always75 BB share gang checking inYeah, I always feel I'm fucking myself when I buy on NYSE.

They're a software company now.They\u2019re starting partnerships with AMZN and SNEDid your order fill? It won\u2019t fill til open. What you see now for options ends at market close and will update at market open.\n\nOptions can\u2019t be traded after hours or premarket so prices you see are as of 4pm ET yesterday. The price increase in BB after hours and premarket doesn\u2019t get reflected in the option price yet until market opens at 930no idea, I just have a lot of XIU lolBasically stonks go up and they share their wives.Same.I'm aware but what makes them cheap other than their inability to make a profit on software? By the time they open up the market at $11.50 I don't see it as cheap at all.Ahh gotcha. So that\u2019s why GME options are so much more expensive.Cheap on a x rev and compared to competitors.I guess I've just followed and been disappointed in BB for so long I just can't get excited about it again. Big upside is that apparently they may get a cash infusion from the Facebook settlement.",

Thinking of going in on this \ud83d\ude80What\u2019s the different between that and if I do $10c 3/19?Buy shares dude don't gambling for 1 dayOnly if you have the buying power to execute the contractDon\u2019t let them expire, sell them before then at profit.You make your profit based on the interest in the contract and how much time is left in it. You can still make a small profit without reaching the break even price if it starts to move up in a way that the contract becomes more valuable for it\u2019s strike price. Once you see what your max profit is like you want to sell to close before stock price and the contract price falls more. It\u2019s easy to miss ouut and for the contract to fall in price quickly but sometimes you gotta be patient too. To be honest I don\u2019t know shit about delta theta and all that other stuff but there are tools online that you can see how the contract is valued on a chart by searching the stock on the website.Depends on your broker... I know robinhood sells the contract for you if you don't have enough purchasing power.  \n\nBut it's usually it's a good idea to NOT let it expire and sell for profit a day beforeWait, let me ask your wifesame. i jumped in after a december DD, bought 1/15 9c and sold 2 days ago at -95%. I cant believe my timing.Same here for a loss. Feels bad. I still have a Jan 2022 15c I bought last month though.Profit is profit manNot just Sony. APPLE will use QNX for their car.

Am retarded.$30 by EOM. It will be the next GME if we use our collective will to make it so.EOW would be literally today.Depends if boomers realize the significance of blackberry being in damn near every EV. Unfortunately boomers always disappoint so I think $100 is overly optimistic.Just put in orders to sell everything at open \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80I have 12c 2/5\n\nEdit: probably going to buy more 12c 2/5 calls$10c 3/19I personally plan on holding a couple of months with the sort of news they have been dropping.  I think post-covid we are going to be seeing a real surge in EV related markets, especially with many places trying to push electric vehicles by certain years.I have no know idea. But I know exactly that it'll be \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 next couple months.No problem <3Gonna do 12 of 1/22 15c, wish I could do more lolDrops below the strike? Then it can\u2019t exerciseQNX is an Operating System designed by Blackberry that's geared towards Artificial intelligence. The main target is Autonomous vehicles (EV OR ICE doesn't matter). Every OEM is basically writing their own Autonomous driving program but none of them have a developed OS.\n\nBlackberry QNX is already in 175m cars and it will only rise with EV\n\nOnly other competition is Linux, which when it comes to safety regulations it will not passMisspelled, I meant to click M instead of W. I need to sleepfuck... well i\u2019m still hard either way \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Shit....i mainly do long term investment but I\u2019m going to ride the BB ship.Personally after this much of a gain, I wouldnt touch long options cause of IV. I have stocks and might sell some puts to open.Ok I think I understand. Will read more. Thank you \u2764Which cars already use this out of curiosity? I\u2019ve been sleeping on BB so all this is new to me.Linux isn\u2019t really one thing. That said, you\u2019re correct. The trend with shit products is to develop something running on internal Linux.\n\nThis is great and high quality IF you have high quality dev team AND SYSTEMS ENGINEERS to make sure that your underlying product is secure.\n\nWhat you end with most of the time? A product that has a hole somewhere in the underlying OS that no one is good enough to notice and patch. \n\nThe amount of IOT devices I see that are literally a shit app slapped onto a random Linux distro and slapped into thin plastic and no hardening is ridiculous. IOT Cameras with open telnet ports, IOT bondage devices that get hacked and peoples genitals literally held hostage by hackers ( google it lol ), it\u2019s crap.\n\nWhat QNX offers - from what I gather, I\u2019m far from in the loop on car tech - is an OS they can build off of that is secure instead of an app they slap together.\n\nSo it\u2019s not quite in competition with Linux, Linux isn\u2019t one monolithic thing. That said, yeah BB all the way.God damn it, all in it is!True true, I\u2019ll see what happens on market open. Also have my eyes on SENS.Def look into it. There\u2019s a lot of helpful articles or YouTube videos. For the Greeks focus on theta to start and then IV. It will help you understand WHY the contact is priced where it isXPENG uses it primarily so far I believe in their *Xpeng* P7.Yea I'm not a programmer so I only know as far as what I've researched. What I really meant to say is currently on the commercial sector there's no real competition to Blackberry QNX. I only listed Linux as a possible competitor just because I'm pretty sure tesla AP is built on it or Ubuntu. That being said when it comes to safety regulations and network security, BB will shine all the way since you can't regulate Linux programsYes Sir...thank you very muchSony's new car has it.\n\nApple car supposedly is partnering with Hyundai. Some are saying that's it's Canoo EV instead. Doesn't matter \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 both of those autonomous programs are built on QNX.\n\nNio partnered with Nvidia. Nvidia is partnered with Desay SV's Autonomous driving program with Li Auto. That program is built on QNX. Nvidia is also partnered with BB. Safe bet Nio will run DESAY on QNX\n\nLion EV QNX\n\nBaidu electric car? geely autonomous driving... Built on.... U guessed it.I agree entirely. I\u2019m really excited by what I\u2019m finding out about BBWas a huge Blackberry user back in the day so I'm really excited to see the comeback of a century",

I might do $12.5 1/29UPDATE FOR NOOBIES. \n\nWhen buying and selling calls make sure you always buy your calls first. You never ever want to open a trade selling calls without owning them first. Figured this would be useful for some of you and will save you down the road that can fuck you for thousands of bucks. \n\nSee you all on pluto.I have around 100 too which calls ru buyingI can't believe that I've made money on this POS company.420 shares yesterday\n\nLET'S GO!!!!!I mean at this point you really don\u2019t have much of a choice, eh?Sitting at 12That shit won\u2019t get filled, the pre-market hype will be high. Probably gotta wait till market open! \nObligatory \ud83d\ude80I can\u2019t read but this seems good because the numbers are higher \ud83d\ude80It\u2019s cowardly. $15 1/22 is the truth.Because they\u2019re all doing 15 1/22sYolo! \ud83d\udc4a\ud83d\ude80That video could have made me buy shares in Bing6 1/22 $11 options.

Wtf is 12c??Your problem is you\u2019re thinking just buy because stocks only go upThere's hype because the company has everything, the best tech in a major growth area. Hold for the long term \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50Buy in the morning or wait for a dip?I was thinking either 12 or 12.5 is a safe bet1/15 $11 C 100It\u2019ll hit $14 tomorrow. I\u2019d be 0DTE if it let meIm in at $11 1/29What do you mean? If you\u2019re selling a call you\u2019d have to own the call in the first place correct? How would you get fucked? Smooth brain hereElaborate please...$15C 1/21 LETS FUCKIN \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude801/29 $11 c. Let's go . Last I checked they are at $10.42We are riding it to Pluto my man.Diamond hand is must till before close of expiration!\ud83d\ude80Honestly anything is good. If you're not as bullish, go for a lower strike price. I gambled a measly 10 1/15calls at $10 and I was already up aftermktOh yeah, duh. I'm swinging ARBKF so let's see. I'll probably be priced out when it hits but this is the first time I've caught onto a WSB pumpSoon it will be Bang bros in BusSee I guessed Blackberry but my dumbass was doubting and thought Best BuyOof is right. Idk I made 5k with what I sold it and bought. But still. If it dips I may get back inGoogle it. \n\nCall options - strike price - expiryIt is a call option with a $12 strike price. Look up options trading.I've been broke and I've been broke and I choose to rich everytime LFG \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Yea I\u2019m probably not gettin in on thisThanks for explanation broSee if you buy there won\u2019t be a dip, so let\u2019s just do that. I\u2019m I\u2019m for 175 premarket.Did I fucking stutter?Every moment you wait is the dip. It\u2019s all up from here \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\u201cSafe bet\u201d isnt iv 300%We don\u2019t do safe, we do space missionsFor 1/29?Wouldn\u2019t it expire tomorrow? So what would you have to do? Sell it or exercise it? (Also idk what it means to exercise it)Nah , you can actually sell a call without buying one first,  you just need to put a margin in to be allowed to do that tho , it's very risky and I don't recommend it . Selling a call outright basically means you are selling someone to buy 100 shares of X stock . You would basically be writing a contract. \n\nWhen you buy a call however you are buying someone else's contract so when you sell it you are basically selling the original contract you bought.When you go to trading options you have the option to buy or sell a call. You can technically sell a call without owning it , if you do this and the buyer of you call excersises his call option you would be held liable for 100 stocks. \n\nIf you buy a call option , let's say  1- $15c 1/29 and then sell it for a profit loss  you wouldn't be held liable since you started with buying a call .\n\nSelling a call outright without buying one first and called shorting and will hold you liable for a chance of assignment.$15C 1/22 LFG \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Godspeed! I bought 165 shares in early December.For sure appreciate it!Grats and fuck you. \nWhat calls are you thinking?\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02LmfaoOK IM BUYING IM BUYING LETS GOI laughed so hard coke came out my nose.  Had to cut her hair off and sift it to put it back in there.Sorry, I'm a young buck who's new to this. I hear ya loud and clear!Any ideas then? Otherwise sharesYeah for 1/29I can still sell before 12 pm PACIFIC TIME.  But I am definitely not exercising it.Oh ok thanks for clarifying, it\u2019s taken me two straight days for my autist brain cells to synapse this infoWonder what we are gonna be eating on PlutoYoooo I didn\u2019t selll off them calls wtfThis is a total noob question I can probably just get 6 contracts and I\u2019ll probably do $12c 1/29 but would I make less money if I bought 46 shares instead of the call? Both cost the same amount reallyNo worries . We aren't wall street , we share the wealth mother fucker.  Lets get this money.A call is worth 100 shares. \n\nThe amount of people who have no idea what calls are on this sub is retarded. \n\nYou are buying the option of buying 100 shares at a set price. \n\nSo $12c 1/29 means you are buying the option to buy 100 shares at $12 on the 1/29. \n\nIf the price goes to $13 then you have a contract worth ~ $100. If the price hits $15 then you have a contract worth $300. \n\nIf you buy 6 calls at $12 and the shares hit $15 then you will have contracts worth $3600. \n\nIf you buy 46 shares at $10 and they reach $15 you will have made $230.Dude honestly I\u2019m pretty noobie when it comes to this too, but if u want long term growth, I think u gotta go with the shares.This is gonna be my first options trade im scaredAll in 15c\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80More risk in calls but more reward. If you don't hit your strike price by expiration your investment goes to 0. You could always sell out prior to expiration though. Each option contract gives you control of 100 shares so it's really levering up that initial investment.For options, dip your feet slowly.  Dont spend your while wad prematurely.  Also start with longer expiries as opposed to really short dated ones until you get a better feel for IV, hype, and greeksAlso what do you think about $12c 1/29? Are you gonna put in positions tomorrow at open?Thank you for explaining it to me!!!I'm in the Sept $10 calls. I got it today when the stock was at $9. Hopefully see a good return on this already tomorrow but I'm holding it through. I think this stock has room to run. I think it will hit $12 by 1/29 but you have to see what the premium you're paying on the option is. For example, if you're buying the $12 and paying $2 per contract that means  the stock needs to hit $14 for you to break even. From what I saw earlier today, the premiums on the further out options were cheap for the upside. I got my calls for 2.80. If I was going in for more I'd look at the $15c further out but $12 1/29 may not be bad depending on that premium.  Stocks up big after hours so everything is going to jump tomorrow morning.that's gonna be pretty risky with only about 2 weeks to expiryI\u2019d literally pay you to mentor me.. thank you so much for helping me understand. So if I did $10c  1/29, and since that\u2019s the deeper ITM, the less the stock has to rise in order to break even. Would that be a better/safer call?No, if it's deeper in the money you will have to pay for that. It is embedded in the price of the call. There are several inputs to the price of the call including the share price, the strike price, how volatile people think the stock will be (higher during events like earnings releases), and time until expiration (theta). If you buy a $10c and the stock is $11, there is already $1 of intrinsic value that you have to pay for in addition to paying for the other components. If it's at $11 and you buy an $11c then there is no intrinsic value and you're paying for only the other components. As you move the strike higher from the share price the lower the option will cost just due to the lower probability of reaching it. If you pull up yahoo finance you can look at the options and see how the price changes based on different strokes, expiration dates, etc.  There are also implied volatility calculators out there that can show you what is priced in. When some of these stocks get moving you can see implied volatility of 100%+ which means you're paying a steep premium.",

I\u2019m jumping in tomorrow when the market opens and it\u2019s my first time buying options so I\u2019m confused on what to dountil it stops printingNot the way... 3/19 7c \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80HAHAHA I know, he\u2019s like \u201cYeah... right behind you Randall...\"This is the way. See ya there space cowboy!you jinxed it.ProofTrue and long term tax as wellHow come?What would the difference be if you did $12 1/29 callAny recommendations on what calls to get when the market opens tomorrow? I was thinking $12c 1/29Pick up the phone start dialing and just be yourself!This shit\u2019s dropping, I got 200 at 9.13Is this a better idea or 1/29 $12? I don\u2019t understand how it really works this will be my first options buy. Also I\u2019m talking about for tomorrow, which one would be better?So how\u2019s this work exactly?\n\nYou\u2019re betting that by February 19th the stock will reach $14. And if you\u2019re right you have the right but not the obligation to sell your shares or something?What position?Both are goodProfit on a call is unlimited, profit on a put is limited by the fact the stock can't go lower than zero. There is some after hours things you can do but its limited.are you meomg I found my people.No one knows how to do anything here, retardOnly some brokers allow it and only after you make a special request.  \n\nBut don't worry,  you can buy shares now and strap on for the ride.Beware of the options!I bought an option once. Cost me $140.\nThats the whole story.I had 4 options for $12.5 and I sold them all at close today. Made a ton of money but I could\u2019ve made moreSo $75?This killed me when I was trying to buy more GME, had money waiting to go in but due to the holidays(banks closed) it took a while. Couldn\u2019t buy more at the dip when it was around $14, by the time my money was in it was $17. Though after last two days, not the worst case scenario.Roger that, I'm in!500 shares \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80  how about to the \ud83c\udf1a\ud83c\udf1a\ud83c\udf1aBeep boop beep boop \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80This was my approach.

All we gotta do is pick the next meme stock and here we go :)Should I do $10c 3/19 when the market opens tomorrow? I\u2019m think of doing that, it\u2019s gonna be my first options buyWhen you say 10$ calls does that include the premium or that\u2019s just the strike priceStocks can go down, Stonks only go up\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80>\tAlso BB \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nThis is the most important point.Widely considered some of the most secure endpoint technology (mostly in vehicle computers) on the market - with self driving/more computerized cars on the horizon those things need to be hyper secure. Plus Canada. Plus recognized name.\"making stuff\"I know it\u2019s a month old, but it gives a little more context other than because r/wallstreetbets posting rockets.\nBut just in case: \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80I\u2019m going to watch it for a little bit, might buy more calls if it looks like a longer term trend, I think it will though, next GME! \ud83d\ude80Yeah my calls are dropping, I\u2019m hoping tomorrow it will bounce up again.I wondering if I should sell my 9$ callsI NEED TO KNOWSooo, 20-never?I think I'll stick with shares for now until I do some more research!Would you recommend I buy $7c 3/19 tomorrow or $12 1/29I\u2019m dumb and trying to be less dumb. Why buy at $7? Isn\u2019t it at 10? I\u2019m missing this crucial part!\n\nYou answered this in a later post never mind. Thank you!New here. Why a $7 call when it's at 9~ currently unless you expect it to go down? Eli5?\n\nI made a 15c for 1/22 because I have no money and I had the funds in my accountI would honestly buy straddles if you gonna play. BB has been giving up gains every pop. I\u2019m super long term on blackberry 370 shares and 3 7C\u2019s 2023(I have a small account). Premiums are gonna be al types of fucked. Wait for the eventually dip and get in long. Let IV chillWhat date did you set it for?It\u2019s not better or worse, it was just a cheap premium and I\u2019m optimistic for the stock to take off. 1/29 $12c is perfectly fine if you\u2019re looking for a shorter term play, seems fine to me if the premium allows you to buy the volume you wantit's a call, not a put.\n\nyou're buying a contract to purchase 100 shares of $BB for $14/share on or before 2/19. So if it goes over $14, you make money. Let's say it's $15, you exercise the option and buy those 100 shares for $14, so you're automatically up $100.\n\nWhat happens more often though is that people buy and sell just the contracts without necessarily exercising them. So like I buy a contract for 1/15 9c and I pay $0.27/share ($27 total price for the contract), then the stock goes up and suddenly the ability to buy shares at $9/ea becomes more desirable so the price goes up and now that same contract is worth $0.54/share, or $54. \n\nso to somebody who has the capital to exercise it, they see that the stock price is currently $9.60/share, which would be $960/100 shares, or they can buy my contract for $54 and buy 100 shares for $9 per the contract = total price for them comes to $954.Nah, 14 is the strike price, depending on his premium it might have to reach 15+ to break even. He won't buy the shares., instead he'll just sell the option so some other retard will buy it.All of them.Thanks for the info!We are all the same.That was all my parents would let me borrow. \ud83d\ude02Yea that\u2019s not bad at all, such a bad time to make a deposit on my part before a weekend lolAll in on 1/15 20c \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Ive been in since 2018....get me back to green boys. 300 at $13.01 and still have room to avg down lolBut what happens if it goes wrong?Just trying to \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 my way through lifeFuck \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b boomers and anyone else, Long Live BBNone of us know what we are doing all we know is stocks only go up \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Also new.  If you bought 1 contract and it failed to hit strike price, do you now owe the cost of 100 shares of the stock, or have you just lost the max price?Bro, 3k savings from last few months all in. I don't got knee surgery but hey \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 rightAlso has to be small enough, let\u2019s not kid ourselves, we\u2019re not influencing Amazon, but we can influence small and mid cap stocks... and Tesla for some reason..Yeah, of course it'll give it plenty of time to get wayyy above the breakeven.\n\nRemindMe! March 19, 2021Strike price. I paid an avg of $0.90 for each so I've already made money.Context<\ud83d\ude80It also went up on that news and then went down right after even after good earnings.\n\nI'd love to know the real reason it spiked besides everyone happened to remember the whole amazon thing.Nah bro that shit is gonna print.you got itYou still might profit, but generally buying OTM calls with a short expiry is very stupid. Its always safe to just buy slightly ITM calls for a bit longer period out7c is too far ITM for how far it moved after hours. Something like a 2/19 9c wouldnt be bad. But dont wait much longer after market open because its going to moon.Because the deeper ITM you are, the less the stock has to rise in order to break even. Since you are so far out OTM on short expiry, you\u2019re more likely to lose your money. But this is a meme stock so it has crazy growth, who knows.So essentially they\u2019d either spend $960 for 100 shares of a stock at $9.60 OR they spend $954 for 100 shares at $9 right?\n\nThe latter being the obvious choice because they not only pay less but they\u2019re getting the stock at a discount. \n\nAm I understanding right?This is the type of comment I\u2019ve been looking for, THANK YOU!Now is the time to learn. I rarely do options (FD\u2019s) and I\u2019m all-in here. Now you can be like the GME autists.My moms boyfriend said not to gamble the money. Good thing I can\u2019t lose money on bbAlso use wealthsimple, hate that their prices are delayed by 15 minutes lol, have to have my browser open to check live prices.Let's go 1/15 9.50Your wife and her boyfriend leave you, Cuck retard!\ud83d\udcaf \ud83d\ude80My god i love this group.

Appreciate it.correct. you can generally expect contracts to sell for the difference between the strike price and the share price + a slight discount.\n\nedit: which is also why calls can have such impressive gains, because they can be really cheap when they're out of the money and really valuable when they're in the moneyGood callToo late for that, I am now Mrs CohenJust bought 4 1/29 10c because yolo \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80He says like we didn't put the GME shorts in the poor house last week xDYeah you would probably be fine with that.i\u2019m new.

You're paying a premium so that you can pay double by sometime in 1-2 months.  \n\n\nUnless call options are better if you think you can get the broker to let you buy and sell the calls immediately, therefore foregoing the need to have the money to buy the stocks.Someone fill me in on how to read this.

Look at all of the vintage \u201cshit\u201d that has taken over.only one with any sense in this thread.  the company is in an industry where every single competitor absolutely prints money (especially this past year) while BB somehow manages to burn cash doing absolutely nothing.  absolute trash.They're way more about software nowadays, look at their website.

GME seemed weird, but it made a lot of sense if you informed yourself properly. BB is just some wanna-be stock imo. Could be entirely wrong thoughIt fucked me today and I\u2019m not proud of it. Red is bad, apparently.When you sell a $16 covered call back in November... That's how you get Fed on PLUG.He\u2019s probably riding the short busMan I\u2019d go yolo it and then it would tank. I should\u2019ve gotten in a couple days ago for the fresh tendies. Imma stick with BB.I\u2019m the original autist.Thank you, you guys are awesome. Much love!I\u2019m in for $10k, let\u2019s go \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Doneor maybe 3 used models?Current M3 is superior in every way so you need to wait until after the refresh anyway.So are we anticipating BB to moon now or???Ok. Lesson learnt.are you fucking stupid WSB absolutely caused the squeeze. We owned like 20% of the shares.I'll bet my kids future on the memeability of this one.BB is also easy to spell which is a real plus.Been awhile since I hopped on a meme so goddammit I'm in.  AH stonks and callz tomorrow.Soon9/17 $9C and I\u2019m in the money after only 7 days with 8 months before expiry and no idea what to do with calls that far away6/18/21 $15 call. Up 265% today. 40 contracts, finally in the green today. Up about $1600Bought the 10 and 12.5 back in Aug... up 600%+ and 400%+ since. \n\nBe wary, it pulls back over time but the news is buzzzzzzzzzinYou are stupid, but probably more confused than stupid.\n\nLEAPs work just like any other option, they're just a year+ out.\n\nThe nice thing about them is they derive a large part of their value from time, so they stay worth a lot of money even if price goes against you.\n\nthey have a strike price just like any other option and if the strike price is below current price, you are ITM on a call and OTM on a put. Just like any other option.Calls or sharesOnly conference I found on BB's press release site is at 1:15 pm EST: \n\n[Needham\u2019s 23rd Annual Virtual Growth Conference](https://wsw.com/webcast/needham103/bb/1838040)  \nFriday, January 15th, 2021 at 1:15pm ET  \nRyan Permeh, BlackBerry Chief Security Architect & Co-founder of Cylance and Eric Cornelius, BlackBerry Chief Product Architect in virtual conversation with Richard Valera, Needham & CoI think it\u2019s at 1:15pm ET. It\u2019s their Annual Virtual Growth Conference.30 here lol1:15 ET iirc...You will most likely want to get in early and fast. BB's ceo Chen just announced deal with Sony.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I'm an autist, please make sure to not take my advice.STOCKS ONLY GO UPI only got 2 - BB  1/21/22 $10C1:15 I thinkThe futureClick BB\n\nTrade options\n\nBuy call\n\nMake sure Jan 15th is selected\n\n\nSelect your strike price\n\nClick buyI bought a few hundred shares in the 6s. Sold bc it wasn't moving fast enough. Oops.People were talking about BB far before that, you\u2019re the one needing to catch on you autistLeaps?Where do you go for solid leap DD?Was joking. Entered in when options were trading ~0.10LeverageFor the most part people do not exercise their options, even if they are far in the money. They usually get sold before expiration, or expire worthless if you made a bad bet.You can resell the option contract and keep all the profit from the stock value increase. (without buying stock)100 shares is $900. But 10 contracts at .90 each is 1000 shares for $900. So much more profit/loss potential for the same price for those who are lower on capitalYou can make way more buying options than shares. If you buy 100 shares at $9 and he sells at $18 he's only making $900 in profit. And that's assuming the price doubles. \n\nMeanwhile he could buy options for February or March for a $10 or $15 strike and make significantly more than $900. If you're crazy confident a stock will hit a certain price and aren't afraid of some risk options can make sense5x $15 calls, exp feb 5th.\n\n1x $15 call, exp march 19th.\n\nThese are pretty far OTM (outside the money) though, so if you aren't a YOLO FOMO WSB artist you might want to buy something closer to the current price and or longer dated.\n\nBut I think we rocket into tomorrow.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:  \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Same pretty pls I'm newJust ask your wife's boyfriend to explain it, that's what I do.Thanks for asking this question I've had no idea for ages what this shit was.Google options platforms ukIdk for sure but check if Degiro available in uk. Also tradestation and interactive brokers, but aprooval takes a few days.Interactive brokers or tastyworksYou won't be able to trade options in the UK, however you can trade CFDs or spread bets which both allow you to leverage you money. Just be aware of your margin and ensure you have sufficent funds for your position.Ya I was trying at 8.53 , the ln 8.65, 8.75 finally just set limit of 8.90 and filled at 8.90Not enough rockets. Not fully convinced yet.You got the right ideawhy are they misalignedJudging by the rockets I think BB should worth $300 a share by the end of 2021You clearly have no idea what you\u2019re talking aboutWhat makes you think I'm kidding. In fact, I've rationalized 1000 shares now. Idgaf if it gaps up I'm in baby.This is WSB, Wendys doesn't pay that much.  He meant, literally $30.

See you on the bright side of the Moon! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80What call should I make for tomorrow? Do I buy one set to expire tomorrow?I think you're lost, r/investing is -> that way.I bought 1 call cause why not. Dumped the rest in shares. Retards to the endI literally opened my trading account like 3 days ago and all this is new to me. I was told options are complicated so it kinda scared me away. I bought a 2/5 $11 call @$1.06 just to see what happens tomorrow. Hope this works out.how is that percentage calculated? What did you pay for the call and what's the target? \ncan you explain to me: options are shares make the same amount of money or not? \n\nlet's say the stock is $10, and you have $20 call. \n\n* you buy 100 shares for $10 (-$1k) and sell for $20 (+$2k) you made $1k profit\n\n* you buy a $20 call for $X (idk how much, but i assume not much, say -$100). Then you exercise the call to get 100 shares, you pay -$900 ( $10*100 - what you already paid, correct?) and sell for +$2k). It's the same $1k profit right? \n\nSo the percentage you listed is the difference between call cost ($100) and net profit ($1000)?? So in this example it's 900%?At what strike and premium?Exactly what I told myself \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80for once im glad I didn't inverse OP. good call my guy9.50 1/22 checking inMe too. I bought 10 contracts for 10c expiring tomorrow. First time doing this.\n\n\nShould I sell them before or after the conference?Dang bro. Serious?Basically, IoT are sensors capture loads of data, and narrow (and maybe broad) AI need as much data as possible to learn. \n\nLike I'll be surprised if there isn't IoT devices in condoms by 2026, so you can have an app that tells you how good your wife's boyfriend is in bed.\n\nAmazon's partnership with Blackberry\nhttps://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blackberry-collaborating-with-amazon-web-services-to-demonstrate-safe-secure-and-intelligent-connected-vehicle-software-platform-for-in-vehicle-applications-300981115.html\n\nIoT Market Going to fucking mars by 2026\nhttps://www.eutelsat.com/en/blog/5-trends-proving-iot-is-the-future.htmlAw\n\nI'm full retard, I just don't have the Autist ability yetyoure not retardedBecause im retardedAll the patents sold to Huawai, the largest Chinese phone manufacturer, their new phone, their role in EV technology.

But Black Berry is not the \ud83d\ude80 you wanna be on..\n\nI used to own a Black Berry Bold 9700 or whatever it was back in a day. Had to make two 911 emergency phone calls in life or death situations then. Both times someone died. In one of those situations the victim could have been saved if they could have gotten there seconds sooner. But.. Both times the emergency call dropped. Fucking dropped! Just like their \ud83d\ude80. Through the investigations they found that the call dropping was 100% the devices fault. I found out then that they were notorious for dropped calls and very quickly bought a differant brand phone. When I told one of my engineer friends over at Black Berry this, he confirmed to me it was a known issue. He is now one of the department heads.. Love the guy.. But yah.. Fucked up..Screw it sold some T and bought 22 more of the same. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80I heard they were gonna discuss some things Friday so I believe there isNews tomorrow according to post, sell tomorrowyes, he really did miss itI had some money put aside...it is my destiny.

Bought Jan 2023 calls right then and there. Now there's news of them getting partnerships with AWS and EV industry? That shit is dynamite baby.I have the option to buy 6600 shares for the premium of 10k because I have 66 contracts. Most people don't actually take the shares, they just sell the contract at a higher priceFor selling a call option, are you only exchanging the premium? Do the stocks themselves ever change hands? Meaning whomever I originally bought a call option now just instead owes those 100 shares to whomever I sold it to?Thanks.

Assume the premium jumped to $1 per share.\n\n$1x100=100.\n\nHe can now turn around and sell that call and make $90 in profits on the premium without exercising the call at all.\n\n$90/$10=900% profit.\n\nFull disclosure I'm a super noob retard and learned this from a YouTube video yesterday.I went this route too.

Sell the original and buy more?  Why would that be more beneficial than hanging on to the original that was purchased at a lower premium?I\u2019m a bit worried this is going to be a palantir redux where it rises fast, but the. it\u2019s stagnant for a long time, and a better use of capital would be to sell one or two contracts to invest somewhere else that\u2019s on the verge of busting through.You should buy shares. \n\nA call is where you\u2019re buying the rights to 100 shares and basically you\u2019re gambling on the possibility it will go up to a certain amount by a certain date. Rocket potential upside and catastrophic potential downside (if it doesn\u2019t reach what you predicted it would, you lose 100% of it, and it goes down quickly if you guess wrong). Also, once the rocket has initiated liftoff, you e pretty much missed the possibility of making a profit on calls. \n\nTLDR: buy shares until you\u2019re ready to go full R.Calls are bets that the stock will go up in the future and give you a right to buy 100 at a certain price (or you can sell the contract)Only one rocket emoji is terrible. Time to buy puts!DD?Sadly you can\u2019t trade options on Etoro (neither Revolut, which - as a Europoor - I\u2019m using. Thinking about switching to Interactive Brokers).\nBefore you get into options trading, definitely watch videos / read about it first. It\u2019s a fuckin\u2019 casino: it can give way higher returns than just owning a share, also zou can easily lose all your money (see posts flaired as \u201cLoss\u201d, aka lossporn).\n\nAlso welcome to WSB, happy trading and fuck you in advance for your gainz to come ;).Hmmm strange I just checked and its there for me. Next to \"discover\"If you go back to the trade options page, to the left of the dates you should see a tab that says \"Discover\"\n\n\nI recommend clicking that and reading through the Robinhood info they provide on that page and then watching a few Youtube videos.\n\n\nI've read countless reddit posts/comments about options trading but what really helped me was seeing others do it via a video and then making some low risk ones myself.Hell ya!! Quick question you may know. I bought calls after market for .83 cents. Will they now not go through bc the post market? I\u2019m an idiot!!!No shit, retard.The guy who sold it to you is hoping that it expires worthless, so no stock ever has to change hands. And the vast majority of people buying calls are not doing so with the hopes of obtaining 100 shares of a stock, but rather to have that contract itself rise in value so they can sell the contract for a profit. But once it's been created, that option basically goes into a pool of options at the same strike and expiration, so sellers aren't under contract with a particular person, but more just the market itself.\n\nAt least that's how I think about it in my limited understanding, I'm far from an expert, having just started this hobby of messing with options after Fantasy Football season ended. I'd recommend checking out some basic options tutorial type videos on youtube if you've got a little time, the basics can be grasped fairly easily IMO.Check out https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/\n\nIf you really want to learn and you use Robinhood, this video is as good as it gets:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SD7sw0bf1ms\n\nYou should really be thinking of options as just that, options. You are paying a **premium** to buy a **contract** which gives you the option to **buy 100 shares** at the desired **strike price** anytime from now until the **expiration date**. You can **exercise** this option at anytime, or you can sell the contract back for a profit/loss.\n\nBut yes, it's essentially a \"bet.\" I think that video explains all you need to know.

This might sound argumentative but I\u2019m genuinely curiousThe console cycle isn't really priced in. Look at the last 2 cycles in historical data.

So OTM PUTS?My sources have told me GameStop inc. is done and not just on twitch.The farther OTM an option is, the more money it makes moving closer to ITM.\n\nThe closer the expiry, the more money it makes as it moves closer to ITM.\n\nTake profits from a conservative leap that printed early and roll them into a closer expiry or a farther OTM or both. \n\nIts definitely an increase in risk in exchange for a larger profit %.\n\nEdit: If IV has changed drastically, maybe hold onto the original?

(Im only few days old here lol)100 fooldo you have to buy all 100?BBI'm not the one to ask, I have no idea how options work. I just buy them. No you\u2019ll need to readjust at open for a higher price. Since it mooned after close today the options prices you see currently won\u2019t fill.Trying some covered calls with BB let\u2019s see how that goes.If the stock rises to make the option valuable, why would someone *ever* sell it? Wouldn't they get a significantly better margin just executing and instantly selling the shares? Maybe they think the stock won't rise enough and try to sell it to someone who thinks it will. But that's it, really.\n\nIf you aren't buying the option to hold the shares, I guess the only reason to sell it is the edge case that you fail to believe in it anymore and want to reap back some of the premium you paid. Maybe?Just ordered a 12 dollar call expiring jan 29th. It still needs time to execute. Good call or nah?Nice video. I'm not a retard like you guys but extra knowledge never hurt. And who knows, maybe in a year or two I'll have some side cash I can yolo on the next GME...$0.53 this morning. I sold them at $1.50. But then I decided to go back in with 5 1/22 12CIf you can guess the market right, and you're not getting screwed by the market, yes.  Absolutely.  Hands down, 1000%.\n\nBut on average you're not right.  You're going to get it wrong.  You will lose these calls.  Look at the loss porn.  Study them.  Those are calls.  If they bought shares and just held and moved on with their lives they'd be fine.\n\nThe honest most accurate call- and this is the most boring answer- is to have time in the market and to not to try to time the market.\n\nJust buy some shares in something you think works, or you have a hunch on, and forget about them till a few years later or when the market rallies on something and you think you need to make a move.   And just keep piling on new shares, market up or down.  It adds up.The option gives him the right (but not the obligation) to buy 100 shares for $15 each. That means that if the share price is $15.01 the option contract is worth 1 dollar, because he can buy the shares for $15.00 and sell them for 15.01 for a profit of 0.01 x 100 shares. At a share price of $16 the contract is worth 100 dollars. Basically, for every penny it\u2019s over 15, he makes a dollar.If the share price is $15 or below, the contract is worth 0 because its cheaper to buy the shares on the market than to buy them for $15 dollars each. He then is out the money he paid for the contract.\n\nAll these amounts are based on the share price at the day of expiration. If it hits the $15-mark before that it is worth more because of the time left componentThe short of it is; Most people sell the contract (particularly here) to someone else on the market just like you would sell a stock.  If the stock is worth more than the options are worth he /she makes a lot of money.  If not, the contract is worthless and he/she probably lost the contract fees and commission (typically they let the contract expire by the date listed).\n\nThe difference between the stock and the stock option is the stock has equity.  You get to keep the stock even if it falls in value and you can always sell at a later date.  The stock option becomes worthless after the expiration date, plus you pay a premium just to have it.  Stock options are risky, with huge pay offs if you can guess the market direction.\n\nThere are bigger plays to considered with options as well.  Such as exercising the stock option even if the stock option is below market value (maybe you think its going to be worth more in the near future?).   But this is something you need to consider with some legit due diligence because a lot of actual retardation gets floated around here.\n\nIf you want to throw some money in the pot, just buy a few shares.  Can't go wrong with building the equity.LMFAO. I\u2019ve been researching it\u2019s play money I promise. LFG BABY!!! I wanna make some greeeenIf you're worried watch it early tomorrow and see.

I can but you shouldn\u2019tYes, but you have to tell them you know what you\u2019re doing. Someone on this thread explained the button steps to me since I couldn\u2019t figure it out some time back. In five weeks, I lost about 25%.  That being said, calls also made me about 20% today, so they are a fickle mistress.  I can\u2019t tell you the button presses to do it because I don\u2019t remember them.https://youtu.be/1Y3FzVQi-R8\n\nI\u2019m bold enough to gamble all of my money, but with the internets memory and growing databases, I\u2019m not bold enough to put the word in writing on a website.Oops, my mistakeCertified autist here. At the moment BB calls at a strike price are 1.13 for 10c expiring 1/29. Do I lose the 113 dollar premium when I sell it or is that part of the value?You can either exercise your call and buy those shares or (as most people on here do) sell the contract for a profitBecause in order to execute that option, you have to actually have the money to purchase those stocks, which most autistics retards here, do not, so they sell the option under the total value such that someone else will buy and exercise the contract.\n\nThe reason why you would want to buy options instead of stocks is that you can buy \"the right\" to buy a LOT more stocks vs if you just bought stocks in the first place, giving you a lot more return when you sell that option.Let me just give you a quick example. I bought my first option a couple weeks ago, a 1/29 $12c of Tilray for .38 premium (per share, so $38 total). A few days later Tilray was already over $12 and the option was worth >$100. I sold it, and basically got 150% return. However, that very same option is now trading for over $6.50 premium the last time I checked. That $500+ that I missed out on is the whole point of purchasing that option in the first place.\n\nThat's a simple example but I think shows how my intention was never to own 100 shares of Tilray, despite being bullish on it. I get to collect the rise in price for 100 shares for significantly less money than if I'd purchased 100 shares of Tilray at the time I bought that option when it was trading at about $9.50. Options can give you significantly more leverage, however are much riskier than shares at the same time. If Tilray had tanked, I would have lost my $38 if it expired worthless.Adding one thing here: \n\nThe further a call is from an expiration date, the more time value it has (eg. there's more time for the stock price to rise even more), which factors into the option price too.\n\nSo if your call has shot up in value, then waiting until expiration might lose you $ if the stock price plateaus, as there will be time value decay. \n\nI'm also rtrd when it comes to this but pretty sure this is trueSo that will breakeven at $12.10, so if you're thinking it will get to $12.10 by Jan 29, it's a good call! I would sell about a week or so before expiry if you're up on your position because each day you suffer theta decay (look this up).Start small. Remember with buying calls, the most you can lose is what you put in.Thanks. I'm learning a lot today and getting a good idea how these work. Is it normally better to sell the option once value increases, or exercise then sell the stocks?Thanks a lot for the reply, I didn\u2019t know much about options and this helped me get a grasp on it. So your option of $12.50 on Feb 12 is pretty solid since it\u2019s already at 9.40-ish, right?I'm new to this as well. I was wondering what happens if you sell an option without actually buying it first? Do you then essentially owe whoever bought the contract 100 shares if they exercise the option?Buy high, sell higher you'll still do okPreach. GL in the trenches brothe circle-jerk or BB?Isn't there an update tomorrow?Interesting. Appreciate the response\ud83d\udc99I didnt have much trouble with it, just clicked the button for \"some experience\" and it allowed me to lose money on the stock market in a whole new way!Heh thats rookie numbers i opened an options account last February. Had no clue what i was doing. Down 99% in a month or two. Climbing my way back upOh ok. Thank you btw for defining shares and calls. If I get started on the market I will probably just buy shares xDCertified dumbass here but I will try to help.\n\nFor an options contract you will need to pay the premium. In this case the BB calls are $113 for ONE contract which controls 100 shares.\n\nTMR if the premium rises to 1.23 from 1.13 (113 to 123) and you sell the contract you will get $123. Either way you lose the premium money. It's a matter of making enough money to cover the premium.I thought I read somewhere that Brokers will let you execute and sell instantly? What is the process/option for that? I just opened a TD Ameritrade a little while ago. Wouldn't that be fine by them, especially if they could charge a fee/commission?What stopped you from just waiting and executing? Was selling the option worth more than the 100x(price-12)? I'd figure you'd want to wait to be sure where the peak was and execute on the downslide, as long as it's still above what you spent on the stocks.I guess the math can favor the options selling within a certain risk margin. \n\n\"The option *has* to go up by X more before executing is worth more than the premium now, but if I wait and sell the option later after the stock plateaus, the premiums I'll get will be lower.\"\n\nThis is territory where I can understand the principal a lot faster than I can just do the math in my head. I'm guessing there are calculators or sites people use for this.Very rarely would you want to exercise the option in this case.  Usually people sell.   It\u2019s a more advanced long term play to consider exercising the option if you have the capital and the consideration for the equity appreciating long term - couple of years typically.Nah, it's actually super aggressive.  I'd aim for something more conservative if I did it again.  I mean, what on earth does BLACKBERRY have in store that justifies a near 30% gain in a month.  So 9.4-10ish is a good call.\n\n But the rest of my spreads in steel are doing fine so... \ud83d\ude80You sell the contract on the market to someone else.  That other person then exercises the options.  It's no longer you're issue to deal with.  Typically its a larger firm that's exercising the option to buy the stock.  But that's between them.If tits up just turn the screen upside down to red rocket to the moonyupPuts expire tomorrow I believeYou\u2019re welcome man. Ask around. I don\u2019t know much, but you learn to learn quickly around here with all the fear of missjng out on the rocket ships.Ohhh gotchu. So I just purchased 11c 1/29. So I\u2019d need BB (currently at 10.4) to rise to 11 to be in the money. Anything above that and I I\u2019d be on the moon? \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Just learning, wanted to lock in profits and weed stocks are very volatile, thought it could be a temporary bump rather than what it now appears to be, a stepping stone on the way to the moon. Obviously I am regretful now and feel like I've learned a valuable lesson, but hindsight is always 20/20 and profit is profit.> What stopped you from just waiting and executing?\n\nThe chance that the stock price drops.Ideally sure. But that's trying to time the market, and being risky instead of locking in profits.Awesome thank you!Thank you so much. So as long as I buy the option and then sell it on the market I can make my tendies and no longer have to worry about that contract again.Kek, too bad im still underage so i'm just doing virtual trading on etoro. So i'm with you guys xd (i just started yesterday)Essentially yeah. But you gotta remember that a contract declines in value every single day. I'm looking at the contract right now, and since its a new one if it increased to like 10.7 tomorrow you will already make some money.\n\nI wish you good luck my man! Make that shit print and kick your wife's bf out of your house.Correct.  Just sell it (most likely) or exercise it before the expiration.Honestly, I think everyone should do that to start and learn before time is up.Yea way too broke to exercise that shit. Cheers for the help.",

Keep buying meme stocks if that\u2019s your thingDude...read the fuckin' roomAnyone quoting GME's business as the primary reason behind the move is an idiot. They've done alright given their situation, but the short squeeze from institutions betting poorly is what's driving it up right now.Wait till this guy hears about omnichannel, streaming, electronic downloads, etcCalling them a video game retailer is so ignorant, first of all, like Tesla, when you have a once in a generation type genius in charge you are investing as much in the person as the company and their products, and secondly Ryan Cohen is going to completely rebuild the business for the digital age, 35-40 is the new floorFrom an options standpoint your break even is around $17. The IV is 170% and delta is only .1. There is support around the 17-18 range. Your best bet is GME crashes in Feb and March, and even then you can lose value in IV for not a lot of delta. \n\nWhy jump in front of the moving train this early?The hive mind is the strength of the sub though?  It is a dumb thing when people pile on insults or something but when everyone is ponying up ducats it honest to god affects the market. There was a post here a couple days ago that did the math on the combined might of WSB autists and it rivals some of the biggest institutional players when the horde is pointed in the right direction.They call that a Mushroom Tattoo in these partsAHHAAAHAHH BAI BAI MONEYLol really is a yolo \ud83d\ude02you only lose it all onceI genuinely hope you make a ton of $$$$$Remind me! 14 daysIdk ask your doc cause this is a retarded playGood point.My smooth brain only knows stonks go up \ud83d\ude80At least you bought far out to minimize IV. But yeah it\u2019s hard to short this stock right now, so it\u2019s a tough one for me. I\u2019ve also been burned on short squeezes before. And in my 15 years of trading, GME right now looks like one of those once in a lifetime events. Never seen short interest this high.Please don't joke about thatI think the squeeze will genuinely start next week.Shorts still haven\u2019t covered even with that last run, and that run is gonna force their hand this next week. This is going to $100 at the least, possibly $420.69 if enough people diamond hand it7:00 behind Wendy's as soon as I get off shift.Immediate defensive attitude clearly shows insecurity with being a \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b.

It was a lot easier before, now Wall Street has their hooks in them.I always thought PLTR was long term. Don\u2019t think it needs pumpingPLTR's market cap is too high.

It\u2019s so frustrating. That\u2019s how I felt though when I was losing a lot on GME, but kept the faith and was rewarded. With PLTR I feel 10x better about them then GME. I foresee daddy Karp memes is WSB\u2019s future.Yoo I got almost the same with 110 at 8,72I made the black guy Palantir because he\u2019s fat, Palantir has a huge market cap.

They are a tank. Slow to move, but almost impossible to take down. Once companies start realizing the potential for using PLTR to make sense/use of their data sets, it\u2019s game over.Square moved slowly at first and dropped to $40 at the lowest during the March pandemic crash. They just closed at $232.Honestly think I\u2019m going to move my 93 shares of PLTR at open tomorrow into some BB for the cultureBlockbuster video is next!$BB this is the wayIf Blackberry wasnt named Blackberry with the stigma behind it, it would be a $20bil company right now. \n\n$50 is my target.10-25B market cap?

Let's imagine you are a big swinging dick hedge fund and you want to buy a ton of shares and ride this thing to the moon. But there's still a ton of shares not available for you to buy yet (feb lockup). Of course you aren't going to let it soar preemptively before you have loaded up. \n\nOnce lockup expires start accumulating your positions in the following days / weeks and hold forever.PLTR is extremely predictable and easy to play. Buy when it hits 23/24, sell at 26/27. It's 10% profit every few weeksBrother, Cathie wood just bought 500K shares, we are going to ValhallaI got my shares about 3-4 weeks ago when it reached $9 and then went to $6 \ud83d\ude05 honestly I think still has future, a guy posted a long and detailed DD about BB this week, you should check it out\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwo4ed/looking_for_the_next_rocket_look_no_further_than/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=shareI have 9 shares of GME \ud83d\ude05 everybody here says that this is just starting, but try to get the best price you can \ud83e\udd20Positions for $BB?ON IT!Same, to go with my other 1240.Just bougth 200 PLTR shares.

Buying PLTR every chance I get.Agreed stop trying to steal our spotlight. Pltr is next but wait for us to finish firstGME made us millionaires, but PLTR will make us billionaires.Tsla has entered the chatLet the boys pump!!!!I mean, it is long term, but I\u2019d sure like a price hike!Yeah but you're talking to WSB here. Long term is EOM OTM calls instead of EOW OTM calls.People should sell long dated puts. you can get almost $9 right now for a november $25. You only tie up like $1k of buying power, absolute worst case you get shares at a $16 cost, if it just sits around and goes no where or goes up you make almost a 100% return on the buying power you tie up.Too real.yes just like $TSLA3/19 $10c checking in2 contracts of the same checking in \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80This guy Jelly ^\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udeecWell done Foreignbrohe's also got the worst moves of the threesource?For sure!!!!!

Will dump probably tomorrow and wait for discount on PLTR or maybe hold for twitterThey're like a security company now or something. And signed an automotive deal with a China company to build the self driving software for the car? Something like that. I remember people talking about it back in November but haven't heard anything else about BB till today.Swapped, they are in cybersec, electric cars and software. They also just sold like 70 pattents to Huawei.More buttons = more $$But don\u2019t listen to me because I\u2019m so retarded I can\u2019t even reply on the right commentI say shares if you can afford it. Options to max your leverageConsider it done, il post and dm you tomorrow!Interesting. The 90 patents they sold off was yesterday\u2019s news though, I\u2019m surprised the pop happened today.

I believe 80% of shares will be available for trade after that. Currently I think its only around 20%The day to day prices are different than the big green chart you see. It only reports one price per day when looking at a 3m view, and you don't see the fluctuations that i'm talking aboutDumb question: how are up when it hasn\u2019t hit $10?Same! So I sold some more stuff and bought a Mar $9 and a 2023 $10 callYOLOWhat is their product exactly?Secrets of the trade my friend ;)They don't want us to make money but eventually they will have no choice.Bought 155 (my entire account) sometime this morning, pleas fly againBro, did you even see that sweet 4% AH?What the fuck. What\u2019s your % gain rn bro I need stuff to jerk off toSqueeze me bbyi have apha stocks and calls and the other two... same with BB but with 10 8.5c 1/22 instead... hoping for 20 so i can ring that register.$1500 in $9c expiring on 1/22. Wish me luck boystrust meSame. Ridiculous.Already 20It\u2019ll hit 10 today, 20 next week, then the moon. I\u2019m in @7.40 ;)If BB jumps from $9 today to $20 sometime in the future, that contract for $430 will be worth a lot more (because the underlying asset of BB is more valuable). You could sell to close the contract at any time between now and expiration and take the difference, or, for a call option you could exercise the option at expiration and purchase the 100 shares of BB at whatever strike price you chose. Most people sell the contract before expiration and pocket the profit.Please stop using options till you read some stuff on how it works.Lol dude I don't use RH. I'm literally looking at it on Bloomberg I can see intraday pricing just fine, that's still not a pattern that's repeated more than 3 (maybe 4 depending if you have some leeway around your ranges) times. Hardly something I'd call extremely predictable especially when it's a brand new range for the ticker to begin with...Value of a call is (Intrinsic Value) + (Time Value).  Intrinsic Value is 0 until the stock reaches the strike price.  But Time Value is more complicated, it increases as the share price climbs, and decreases (or decays) as time elapses.  So the value of a call option goes up when the stock goes up, even when it is \"out of the money,\" as long as they go up fast enough to beat the time \"decay\".because people are so certain that it will which makes them willing to pay more for that contract.  If it stayed at that price until expiration, the value would go down.I placed an option order this morning before market but it\u2019s not reflected yet?

Did you pick them up cheap?But why?I literally bought them just after open too for $1.02. Should have stayed at the doctor incase my erection lasts longer than 4 hours.In at 9.10 lets get it.Thank you for explaining this moreAnd the option holder would get $100 for every dollar above their strike price? Ex. $9 contract goes to $20 430 goes to 1530?I mean you're right, i've done it 4 times. But 10% per month is a pretty great return is it not? AMD and Netflix used to do the same way back when, as did TSLA.the time value of GME calls this afternoon was PEAK MONEY.This is probably one of the most concise and well put ways to explain this that I've seen.So the contract itself is fluctuating? As well as the stock? I so so dumbWell well well... I somehow missed that in my DD.\n\nGood lookin out!Yeah like $0.50/contract. \n\nI\u2019m rock hard rn looking at these AH numbers\n\nI also have GME calls that are about to print lolYou wanted a DD not a god damn philosophyI wanted to buy 20c for next year, option was not there.emptied my load at 8.53 lets take it all!!!Option have a value called delta. It determines how the option price changes with regard to the stock. For strikes near the current price(ATM: At The Money) , it's usually about 0.5 meaning for every dollar the stock goes up the option goes up $0.5.\n\nThe lower the strike, the higher the delta.The contract value will vary with time and stock price. It's not a direct 1:1 ratio.Sure I'm not saying that's not a great return, just that thinking it is \"extremely predictable\" when it's only held the range a month and a half is setting you up for heartbreak. I trade ranges on FX which are wayyyyy more stable, and still managed to get burned and lose a few months of profit being the wrong way (and trying to buy the dip) through March when USD rallied hard. And have missed out on some fantastic gains when a huge rally occurs after selling at my PT. Which again, is fine, as long as you know that's how you're playing the stock. You just have to be ok with missing out on the gains in a sustained one way rally...Because changing your mind and FOMO'ing in is usually one of the worst things you can do (unless it's TSLA).exactly, the contract price is fluidYeah which is why some people can make profits on super OTM options when the stock never even gets close to the strike price but is heading in that directionFuck yeah. I missed the GME rocket ship but I\u2019m strapped in for BB (relative to being the poor that I am, anyway).I bought 1000 shares too because my old man still uses a blackberry.I ended up not pulling the trigger on 3/19 $10c. It was in my price range and I just didn\u2019t do it! Regretting it today after chasing like an idiot. I am so close to doing this right\n\nGuess I\u2019ve got til March for it to come back a little.I guess that\u2019s where I\u2019m stuck. I understand that the contracts fluctuates, but how does the stock price effect it?Fair. I hope you're having a nice Thursday my guyGME this week was fun, but the real win for me was actually a 300% play on Tilray calls. I\u2019ve rolled the profits from that into some more later dated Tilray calls and *those* are printing too (and that\u2019s before the opt price reflects this AH fun)\n\nMy account is up like 26% this week. It\u2019s been a good weekLol amazing.\n\nMy only regret if not buying enoughhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black\u2013Scholes_equation\n\nOption price varies based on a number of variables. \n\nYou are partially correct however\u2014***at expiry*** the option\u2019s value is equal to (share price-strike price) x $100 (if it\u2019s a call)That's where the greeks come into play, my man. The delta of an option determines how much the price of the contract fluctuates as the underlying stock value moves.As the other redditors have explained there are many factors at play which determine a contract's price. I'd simply reiterate that the stock price is one underlying value which directly affects your option contact's value. \n\nFor example:\nIf I sell you an option to buy a bar of gold today for $1,000 and the price of a gold bar is also $1,000, then your option is not worth anything (because you can buy the gold bar in the market for the same price I'm giving you the option for). However, if tomorrow, the price of a bar of gold is $1,200, all of a sudden the option I sold you to buy the bar of gold for $1,000 has a higher worth. Most people would sell the option to buy the gold and pocket the profit before the option expires (in case the price of gold bars drops below $1,000 tomorrow). Other people might exercise their option at expiration, and hope that gold is worth more than $1,000 (so they can sell it for a profit or hold on to it long term, if that's their goal).\n\nJust replace \"gold bar\" with \"stock option\" in the example above and that's the general idea.\n\nI didn't realize that most people don't hold options all the way until expiration and instead sell them for a profit until I started trading options. That was a big learning point for me, personally.Now kiss.Can't complain, 4pm and I'm about to crack open a few bottles for a late Zoom Christmas party for work...cheers bud.That\u2019s everyone\u2019s regret when something \ud83d\ude80 to the moon**[Black\u2013Scholes equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black\u2013Scholes equation)**\n\nIn mathematical finance, the Black\u2013Scholes equation is a partial differential equation (PDE) governing the price evolution of a European call or European put under the Black\u2013Scholes model. Broadly speaking, the term may refer to a similar PDE that can be derived for a variety of options, or more generally, derivatives. For a European call or put on an underlying stock paying no dividends, the equation is:                                \u2202        V                     \u2202        t                     +                 1       2                    \u03c3            2                    S            2                                           \u2202                  2                        V                     \u2202                S                  2                                     +     r     S                        \u2202        V                     \u2202        S                     \u2212     r     V     =     0         {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\partial V}{\\partial t}}+{\\frac {1}{2}}\\sigma ^{2}S^{2}{\\frac {\\partial ^{2}V}{\\partial S^{2}}}+rS{\\frac {\\partial V}{\\partial S}}-rV=0}  where V is the price of the option as a function of stock price S and time t, r is the risk-free interest rate, and             \u03c3         {\\displaystyle \\sigma }  is the volatility of the stock. The key financial insight behind the equation is that, under the model assumption of a frictionless market, one can perfectly hedge the option by buying and selling the underlying asset in just the right way and consequently \u201celiminate risk\".\n\n[^(About Me)](https://np.reddit.com/user/wikipedia_text_bot/comments/jrn2mj/about_me/) ^- [^(Opt out)](https://np.reddit.com/user/wikipedia_text_bot/comments/jrti43/opt_out_here/) ^(- OP can reply !delete to delete) ^- [^(Article of the day)](https://np.reddit.com/comments/k9hx22)\n\n**This bot will soon be transitioning to an opt-in system.

    "title": "$LMT - Space/Defense Play",
    "selfText": "I wrote this a few days ago, but figured this would be good info for y'all if you are looking at investing in Space/Lockheed. I'm long Lockheed, and have been prior to the ARK announcement.\n\n**Summary**\n\n$LMT - Lockheed Martin is one of the largest defense contractors in the US. The US just signed the largest defense budget in history, and Lockheed stands to benefit. Here\u2019s the [text ](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/116/hr6395/text)of the bill for reference. Let\u2019s begin.\n\n[About Us Page](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/who-we-are.html)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q8bqhm0isbb61.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c5b996a4732a833ab01285664d9b5c7d8d00cf3\n\nA few things to note about Lockheed Martin:\n\n1. Lockheed historically provides conservative earnings estimates, which enable them to consistently beat earnings and raise outlook for the subsequent year\n2. Lockheed carries a backlog of $144b, which enables them to manage production to consistently hit sales targets\n3. Lockheed historically trades at a discount given their expensive low volume contracts. Investors are looking for diversification of revenue and new opportunity given the limited lifecycle of existing investment (e.g. F-35s)\n\nLockheed reports earnings on Jan 26, 2021. Lockheed projects $16.9B in revenue $6.42B in profit.\n\nHere\u2019s a glimpse at their most recent earnings:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dq0py12lsbb61.png?width=832&format=png&auto=webp&s=de774e12bec9a1d34275f338b807d588970b89ad\n\n**Thesis**\n\nLet\u2019s break this down by vertical for $LMT:\n\n[**Aeronautics**](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/who-we-are/business-areas/aeronautics.html):\n\nAeronautics is a diverse field for Lockheed, with classic names like F-16 and F-35. Fighter jet contracts are a huge source of revenue and backlogs for Lockheed.\n\nAs we can see for Q3, we saw good revenue numbers at $6.7B and $700m profits, which comes out to an 11% margin.\n\nAeronautics will continue to be a strong category for Lockheed. Here\u2019s a few notes from the recent procurement list in the defense budget:\n\n* F-35 contracts were $700M higher than expectations ($4.5B expected vs $5.2 actual)\n* C-130J was $660M higher than expectations ($30M expected vs $690M actual)\n* F-22 contracts were in line with expectations at $360M (vs $380M expected)\n* F-16 contracts were in line with expectations at $590M (vs $615M expected)\n* Laser technology was given about $200M in funding, which should go to $LMT as new procurement\n   * Here\u2019s a recent contract: [Link](https://news.lockheedmartin.com/2021-01-11-Lockheed-Martin-Delivers-HELIOS-Laser-Weapon-System-to-US-Navy-for-Ship-Testing-and-Integration)\n* U-2 Dragon was $16M higher ($16M expected vs $32M actual)\n\nOther highlights that are not highlighted in the defense budget:\n\n* LMT is investing in [Compact Fusion](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/products/compact-fusion.html) research, which would be used for space travel. Unfortunately we haven\u2019t seen much news here.\n\nAll in all - Lockheed was in line or exceeded expectations in the recent defense bill. While these won\u2019t immediately impact the bottom line, they add to the growing backlog and should signal an earnings beat for this vertical.\n\n[**Missile and Fire Control**](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/who-we-are/business-areas/missiles-and-fire-control/products.html):\n\nAnother core area for Lockheed is Missile and Fire Control. This area is more difficult to pick out winners and losers in the most recent defense budget. Overall missiles and fire control seems to be in line with expectations.\n\nFor context - missiles and fire control contracts are not as publicized as aerospace. Most of these are upgrades for existing airplanes/helicopters and not explicitly called out in the defense budget by name. Thus we have to assume that budget in line with expectations means that Lockheed should meet expectations in this category.\n\nOther highlights that are not highlighted in the defense budget:\n\n* Did you know that Lockheed is an industry leader in [battery technology](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/energy.html)? Most military installations with clean energy are using Lockheed battery technology.\n* Lockheed does interesting investments in [exoskeleton technologies](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/products/exoskeleton-technologies.html) for foot soldiers. These contracts haven\u2019t been announced, but should be [$$$. ](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/12/19/1669201/0/en/Exoskeleton-Market-to-surpass-3-5bn-by-2026-Global-Market-Insights-Inc.html)\n\n[**Rotary and Mission Systems**](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/who-we-are/business-areas/rotary-and-mission-systems.html):\n\nThis vertical is super interesting for Lockheed. Representing nearly 25% of revenues, Rotary and Mission Systems references helicopter and other electronic warfare systems (e.g. EMPs and cyber attacks).\n\nThis is another area that doesn\u2019t have public information that we can readily find in the defense budget. There\u2019s plenty of money being thrown at cyber security in the defense budget ($31B), but we don\u2019t know where it\u2019s allocated. Radar systems were also well funded in the recent defense budget, but again it isn\u2019t explicit in allocation.\n\nAs I can\u2019t speak specifically to Lockheed\u2019s performance in this area, here\u2019s a few highlights:\n\n* [Directed Energy](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/directed-energy.html): As part of Lockheed\u2019s laser research, they are building speed of light weapons. Laser research is a huge part of the defense budget (north of $500M in research funding). Lockheed also signed a [$1.2B contract](https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2021/01/lockheed-martin-delivers-helios-laser-weapon-system-to-u-s-navy/) for laser technology for Helios lasers.\n* [Hypersonic](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/hypersonics.html): I will talk more about this later, but very interesting tech being produced. $800M in funding for research in the latest budget and $100s of millions in other ancillary hypersonic research/deployment.\n\n[Space](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/space.html):\n\nThis is the most interesting vertical for Lockheed and going to be a catalyst for earnings. Lockheed is already cleared for producing spacecraft for landing on the moon, and is currently planning to announce new technology in June for returning people to the moon by 2024.\n\nI highly recommend reading through Lockheed\u2019s website on Space material. This is a new industry for Lockheed and a new line item in the defense budget, and is something investors will be looking at closely. Lockheed needs to diversify their revenues, and Space is an easy way for them to grow - already seeing $2.8B quarterly revenues. They are dominating the Space Force budget, and proving to be leaders in this category.\n\nA few callouts:\n\n1. Lockheed is working with Blue Origin, NOC, and a few other contractors on a human landing system for the moon. This is planned for 2024, but we could hear new information in our upcoming earnings.\n2. Lockheed is focusing on data - satellite technology has been a major focus (for weather, space imaging, and missile technology).\n   1. We\u2019ve seen major contracts in this area too: [Link](https://spacenews.com/lockheed-martin-gets-4-9-billion-contract-to-build-three-missile-warning-satellites/) \\- $5B for missile defense\n\n**Differentiator**: The real reason for this **HIGH** conviction - Lockheed has a few differentiators heading into earnings. Here\u2019s what we should expect to hear more about:\n\n1. 5G and 6G technology - if you didn\u2019t know already, Lockheed is a leader in 5G technology. This week they also trademarked a 6G logo today (Jan 11), which shows they are investing in 6G infrastructure that we will hear about in the upcoming earnings report.\n   1. Historically Lockheed has focused on the satellite deployment contracts for 5G rather than the actual technology. However, recent developments for using 5G to power missiles and drones should push Lockheed to the forefront of 5G technology - even for consumers.\n2. [Hypersonic technology](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/hypersonics.html) \\- already a $1B+ line item in the defense budget, hypersonic missiles and aircraft are the future. Traveling at 5x the speed of sound, hypersonic technology has been a major focus for Lockheed, and we should expect major news in the upcoming earnings.\n   1. Lockheed has won major contracts for hypersonic already: [Link](https://news.lockheedmartin.com/2019-08-30-Lockheed-Martins-Expertise-in-Hypersonic-Flight-Wins-New-Army-Work?_ga=2.121726923.1141205913.1610411981-1590128817.1610411981)\n   2. Their latest successful test was on August 8. Lockheed holds an enormous advantage in this category, and should see the bulk of hypersonic contracts moving forward.\n3. Aerojet Rocketdyne - Lockheed recently purchased AJRD for about $5B. Lockheed competes against SpaceX in the reusable rockets space - particular for satellites, and this purchase enables them to have a leg up over SpaceX when it comes to upcoming NASA or Space Force contracts. Costs savings too should be a huge boost. This needs to be approved by President Biden, which we should see news on in the early weeks of his new administration. Super bullish that they are focusing their $18B in M&A dry powder towards Space investments.\n\nInvestors will be looking to the Space line item in the earnings report to evaluate Lockheed\u2019s earnings. The $5B Helios contract should be a huge booster to their revs, and any information on 5/6G and Hypersonic will take Lockheed to the moon.\n\n**Other relevant info:**\n\n* Seeking Alpha: [Link](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4397641-lockheed-martin-contracts-surge-to-123-billion)\n* ARK opened a position on Jan 11 for 66k shares (\\~$22m)\n* ARK is creating a space SPAC that will include LMT\n\n**Trades made**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Equity](https://preview.redd.it/mdfz9klxsbb61.png?width=1496&format=png&auto=webp&s=d60506f0a8a4b0acbf33f06caa453e4a2a3b0100)\n\n[Options](https://preview.redd.it/wdqk2l4usbb61.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b2f0b3503d96bc1003c963fb550b0ac44552a62)\n\nI plan to hold through earnings - an earnings beat should be easy given recent contracts and their backlogs. Historically Lockheed has had bullish activity 2-3 weeks into earnings as people don't want to miss out on them potentially announcing a new contract - 85% of Lockheed's development is classified.\n\nAlso - here\u2019s a few dark pool prints that show you where the money is flowing:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xrb0unmnsbb61.png?width=784&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ec57701cf699ef4464e3d065cb485be2d41c513\n\n**Other speculation:** \n\nInteresting speculation heading into earnings for LMT - there's a new generation (6th) airplane being produced by the military that's rumored to be in production by Lockheed's Skunk Works program. If you are not familiar with NGAD - the 6th generation fighter would replace F22s and pave the way for all future stealth fighter contracts for the US Airforce.   \n\n[https://www.defenseone.com/business/2020/10/lockheed-building-air-forces-secret-fighter/169408/](https://www.defenseone.com/business/2020/10/lockheed-building-air-forces-secret-fighter/169408/) \\- here's a brief commentary about comments made by the CFO of LMT. \n\nThey are expecting double digit growth targets for Skunk Works - both through classified aircraft in development and hypersonic missile technology that is also in development. None of these products are expected to be unclassified until 2024-2025, but we could start to hear confirmation of won contracts that would confirm Lockheed's position as leading in Space Force contracts.   \n\nA lot of times there is a run-up into earnings on the potential announcement of deals like this - if Lockheed announced they signed a contract for the next generation of F22s, they'd be immediately signing a 100B+ contract that would ensure earnings beats for the next decade. Same with hypersonic missiles. There's a reason why we are starting to see price action in the weeks ahead of earnings. \n\nLMT also still has $14B in M&A money that could go towards other companies like KTOS or NNDM (for 3d printing of rocket parts). These could be great M&A plays moving forward for Lockheed as they further cement themselves as a leader in the space industry. \n\nI'm also long $NOC for those that are wondering. ",

Calls?If you want to get in cheaper and position yourself in the defense sector check out $DFEN.530c Jan 2022 \n\nLet's fucking goI'm very familiar with LMT and other people in the industry are also really positive on their future development, but what do you really see as an upcoming catalyst to justify calls vs. shares? Those seem aggressively OTM if you're just looking for leverage.Sexy DD. I\u2019m kinda dumb so some is over my head, but I\u2019m definitely saving this post and reading through it better when I have time tonight.You just gave me the confirmation bias I was looking for. I bought them this morning after reading about ARKX and I also saw Canoe has just got them in one of the other ARK. Besides this I looked at their ROE and said it's a must buyLMT literally to the moon and beyond.  I'm inExcellent DD, thank you for taking the time to put it together. What are your thoughts on why LMT has been down trending the last few months? Volume is super low too. \n\nThinking of buying LEAPS tomorrow, they are dirt cheap.The price of LMT increased 228% during Obama/Biden years. For comparison, it increased 136% during the Bush/Cheney years and its only increased about 34% these last 4 years. LMT gave $2.97M to the dems, and $3.22M to the republicans in the last election cycle so they have lots of friends.Top research & DD as per from this user. Bought equity.35 bagger on my weekly BB calls from yesterday what the actual fuckDegiro I presume? I read recently that some Dutch laws ban the trading of several weapon-related stocks. I was going to buy NOC on degiro and it's not available either.US defense contractor. YOU'RE FUNDING THE ENEMY!!!!! Or something like that, I'm sure.LMT is buying Aerojet-Rocketdyne.  They're going to be able to directly compete with Northrop on any SRB contracts going forward.  LMT gets fucked right now on those because they have to bid out the engine/fuel portion to AR/Northrop (who bought AR's main competitor, OATK a year or two ago), so those companies would jack the price up for LMT.\n\nAn interesting play would be to straight up buy AR's shares so they get converted into LMT's shares post buyout.LMT focuses on AI, Lasers, Satellites, Hypersonic, and Rockets - at least in their Space arena. Boeing has too much bad PR and isn't ready to get into Space as quickly as LMT or NOC. RTX is still struggling after their merger and I don't believe will have as much exposure and will lose lots of contracts in space. NOC is another good buy - I'm long them too.I think Northrop has a better margin of safety and potential for growthScared of some actual DD rather than following blindly like the sheep you are? lmfaoI commented about Aerojet. Biden needs to approve, but given his current enthusiasm, that is not a worry.You can reference my positions if you want the tldrI posted my playsDFEN is is mostly BA which is a turd sandwich rn.  Not the move, imo.Too much exposure to BA and RTX. All the ETFs do. I'm long LMT and NOC.I bought 5k worth of calls based on TA (trading at 200ma), following the algo prints that I referenced in my post, and the run up to earnings. I'm also holding 50 shares and plan to add more over time (hoping to get to a few hundred).\n\nCurious though what you've heard from a DD perspective from others in the industry if you care to share.Volume has been down as there's been no news and Biden getting elected has caused money to continue to flow out of defensives into high returning tech stocks. I'm thinking this trend will reverse a bit in the short term, and definitely by June we could see some good price action.Not even the enemy, I\u2019m from the Netherlands. So it probably has something to do with \u2018morals\u2019Not true about Boeing and space.  Boeing has the NASA Docking systems' Soft Capture system.  It's the standard going forward for all docking platforms for future space stations.\ud83d\udc11Didn't see that in my original read.  My bad.Do you see Biden maintaining military spending despite possible democratic pressure? That\u2019s my biggest worry with this play.Too many words I went to a state college, budEdit: moved to comment under OPI was talking to their other people who can\u2019t afford to go long on LMT but still wanna get in on some action. Great write up btw. I\u2019m long as well, but only because they give me free shares every week for being an employee lolWell that's gay.  Sorry you can't join the play.  See you in the next bagger, friend!What are you using? Im using etoro and it works fine with $lmtOf course. We just signed the largest defense deal in ages and there's billions in backlog revenue.Holy shit you went to college?There is a photo of his positions.The pension/employee benefits seem incredible at LMTI\u2019m in.This is the real shocker.

    "selfText": "I\u2019ve been following this stock for years. Why? I used to work there. USED TO being the key word. When I joined Babcock and Wilcox in 2017, fresh out of college, the company had a nice budget sheet, plenty of cash, plenty of profits to go around. That all changed within the matter of a few months. A couple projects in Germany had gone wrong. These would be know as the 6 Volund projects that almost bankrupt the entire billion dollar company. These project drove morale down and pushed me to leave the company, as they started getting rid of benefits and it wasn\u2019t looking great as to the future of the company. One of the big hurdles for B&W was closing out those 6 Volund projects and pushing ahead and becoming profitable again. This required a couple CEO changes, which ultimately led to B Riley stepping in and bailing the company out with a huge investment at their \u201crock bottom\u201d and implementing their own CEO. The stock price has been through hell over the years, and had a 10:1 stock split at one point (so the pre split price right now is about $0.45). With the introduction of B Riley, however, the company has done a complete 180. For the first time in almost 4 years the balance sheet is green again, the future is looking bright. I\u2019m writing this DD because this stock/company has hit rock bottom, and now is the time to get back in. I\u2019ve waited 4 years for this moment, I got in at rock bottom during covid (around $0.95) and I see a lot more money to be made. \nI\u2019m giving this stock a rating of \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \nSee you retards on the other side\n\nTendies proof:\nhttps://i.imgur.com/rrfS5pT.jpg",

As someone new to the industry I had to get out. I would join the company again now though.Yeah it\u2019s pretty crazy. Keep in mind there was a 10:1 reverse split in July of 2019 so everything should be divided by 10.fucking steps to the basement buddyYes! With the ski slope on top. That was one of my favorites. I forgot to mention it in the post but every one of those projects has a guaranteed service contract so that plant is a yearly ROI for BW.I used to say it was Bab and Wil the cock brothers\ud83d\ude02Options or shares?Like a trust autist. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80So they had 6 renewable contracts and tried to do them ALL at once (Mind you they had never tried to do one before and they decided 6 to start was a good idea, and in Germany of all places). Not only did they try to do all 6 at once but they tried to use their own construction team to build them (little to no experience there either, B&W is mostly an engineering/tell people how to build not build themselves). Sufficient to say it was mismanagement to the tune of about half a billion dollars+ after all the projects came in late. After years of paying liquidated damages (for every day that the plants didn\u2019t start on time B&W had to front what the plant would have made in revenue), they finally released the grasp of the projects last year, and refinanced after almost going bankrupt. It took new leadership (B Riley) to pull them out of the shitty situation and get them back on track. The previous management somehow took a profitable half billion dollars in cash and throw it down the drain, as well as go into debt. It was catastrophic to say the least.Out from under those contracts previously mentioned. Finally able to return to profit, and with Biden taking office renewables/green energy are looking good for the future. Stricter EPA regulations make B&W a lot of money in the United States. Management is focusing a lot on the things that are making the company money now.We need to get more retards on board. This has potential to moon.At least the next 2 years. This thing has been beat into the ground and it\u2019s just now getting back on its feet. B Riley has big plans for restructuring and focusing on renewables.I looked also at their Q3 financials, they look dope. It looks like the management turned the boat around and stopped sinkingSharesIts been 18 hours and im not rich yet, ive got all my liquid capital sunk into this,  biden please make diabetes medicine freeDamn what a mess. If they really are out of the woods on that then $4-5 shares are a steal, hopefully the new management team has their shit together. I've been looking for a nuclear play, I think the energy tides are turning that way along with renewables. Good info man, thanks.After doing more research, they seem to have been extremely adversely effected by the Covid lockdowns, suspending employees 401k match, furloughs, deferring tent payments, etc. to conserve cash. On the other hand, the CEO and CFO have bought back tens of thousands of shares over the last monthExactly. Finally positive EPS.. positive EBITDA. It\u2019s insane how B Riley turned the entire company around. I thought they were going to zero for the longest time.The only thing I'm afraid is the high run up recently, but we will see where the value is in the future. Thanks for the heads upThat run up is a result of what we\u2019re talking about here^^ you also gotta remember this stock is sitting at $0.45 pre reverse split. It\u2019s extremely low.",

So we don't care too much if we'd bought at 15 or 37.It probably makes sense to wait for market open to get in right? Especially with a shit broker like etoro who sometimes opens late on high volume stocksfirst timer here, after seeing all your retarded shit, im allin for 31$ and trust WSB since i have FOMO hopefully it was not to late \ud83d\ude16How does one have access to premarket prices at 5:00am??I am an insomniac and degenerate gambler and put a marker order in to buy 450 shares at open. Wish me luck boisWhat exactly is the point of waiting for the market to open to purchase shares? Will the order not go through at the price shown after hours?

Whatever happens, loving the thrill and community. Never traded in options and I know it's late to the party, but any tips for a low amount ($50) option play, just for the learning experience?But like how is GameStop gonna hit $100? Are they going digital? Let\u2019s be honest, physical games won\u2019t be around forever, with gamepass and Sony working on a gamepass like system, physical games won\u2019t be a thing in 3-5 years, like I just don\u2019t see GameStop surviving the year they\u2019re like RadioShackWill go to the moon, just buy nowStill not late since the squeeze hasn't happened yet. Yesterday was just a correction regarding Cohen joining the Board with his two homies.A donkey doesn't strike the same stone twiceI panic sold it after it went up 50% in a day..Same here, i bought PLTRYou and everyone that felt smart selling covered calls.

Deprive the shorts of more of the float.

Otherwise, you have to wait for the market to open. If you do a market order, it will be filled as soon as possible. But depending on the volume, you might see a large gap up or down from the pre-hour prices.SharesI don\u2019t even see anything over $40 available for 1/15 on RobinhoodMelvin will be the last one!Read the omniDD\n> Will go to the moon, just buy now\n\n\npurely based on the power of memes?Panic buy back before it's already at $100 thenListen to your orders next time!fgtYeah. \n\nIf we don\u2019t get a flood of sellers, the shorts still need to cover pretty much the entire trade able float. \n\nPlus you have a gamma squeeze which is likely to occur. So your MM will buy more. \n\nIt\u2019s a rocket about to fly.how do you get shares pre-market?already aboard with shares, want to get into calls. would 40c 1-29 still be decent?If i knew how to make video memes i would do the springtime for hitler oneStfu you gay bear \ud83c\udf89Okay so I should wait for market open to do the order right? Like right at 9:30, as opposed to queuing one in robinhood right now?Yeah I too believe it will spike and I've been watching the premarket movement, the thing is that as far as I'm aware, queuing up a market buy order on RH is worse than simply placing an order myself at 9:30 correct? Again, new retard, need to get a lesson on these small details.XnetStraya here \ud83d\ude4b hmu for a yarn at midnight hehYea bro. Me and the boys have the alarm set at 3.25 fo our moves. Sitting at 70 shares I\u2019m moving another 3000usd in. Maybe half it out through the day.Sure but very hard to predict. Will Probably wait a few minutes after market open to see how it is going and then decideThank you that makes sense! Really appreciate itWhy not the calls? It seems like they\u2019re more profitable right?\"You underestimate my power!\" - Anakin SkywalkerThere are still a ton of shorts to squeeze, most of yesterday\u2019s volume was high frequency trading.Banks did their DD overnight, realized there was actually safety from bankruptcy after leaving it for dead. They also see the short squeeze, and will now ride it.FactsEasy 100%. No fucking way it won't go to at least 80puts expire friday right?Well, I am German and this is traded in Germany. This is for me not really pre market.Double down in shares. Make it impossible for Melvin to cover ANY of his shortsDude idk I'm buying on euros and baught yesterday for 26 after I sold for 27 and baught today for 30 some more \ud83d\ude02Look the issue with a market order (blind at open) is that the actual price u get might be quite high if there are dips through out the day or usually around quarter of day. But again you're not day trading, the idea with buying now is 1) Believing this thing will explode short term to 60+, then ur entry price doesn't really matter 2) You're holding long term to 100+ and the squeeze doesn't really matter. The issue with the limit order is that if it isn't high enough to actually match a bid you'll be stuck with the price flying, and will have to constantly modify the order with a new price. So, it all depends on your thesis. The idea I think is if you're getting in today price at open should theoretically not matter that much. Even if it dips, it should moon again. But if you think the squeeze already happened, then you shouldn't be getting in today at all.I want to know this too. How tf do premarket orders work?Fuck bro. I\u2019m at 3.30 market open here. It\u2019s brutal.im aussie too you using etoro? \n\nI changed my 1000USD shares at 19 to 5x leverage before market close. \n\nPre market making me cum because now im definitely not hitting the short stop losses etoro sets at X5Hope you're enjoying the gains. Don't get out too early, still plenty of legs on this thing!Isn't that the point of the limit order?  You don't predict you set your happy price and let it run.  If it doesn't happen oh wellbecause Melvin needs to bleed...to get our tendies to the moon and beyond \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Now we need to own shares and hold to raise price. With options you don't own the sharesI\u2019m trying to ask the same lolSource?Yeah. But there is also a gamma squeeze and probably more puts expiring later. It will be vicious.Just buy asapOkay very good info to know, but that wasn't exactly what I was trying to deduce. I was literally wondering what price robinhood will buy the stock at if I place a pre-market order. Will it execute the order exactly at 9:30 for exactly what the price of the stock is at open, or can I expect some sort of delay and see the price go up before my queued buy order is executed? Robinhood allows pre-market trading at 9:00 so if I want to get in on executing my buy order as soon as possible, I should wait until 9:00 and manually execute the buy order then correct? \n\nIt's more a question about the mechanics of pre-market trading rather than the stock itself, my expectation is that the squeeze has either not fully started or still has a ways to go, and so I would like to buy in today as soon as possible. Essentially does it make more sense to buy manually at 9:00AM/9:30 or should I just queue the order now in robinhood and trust that it will accomplish this itself.well, for once there are of course the non-US markets which operate in different time zones..kiwi bro,don\u2019t have a margin account. Would have to pay tax if I did anyway. No tax on shares from capital.Yea she\u2019s good. Fucking app done me in. Bought 1k at 37 and 1.5k at 35. In for a penny in for a pound mate.Sure they are, but by buying shares you\u2018ll add fuel to the short-squeeze.. but go an buy calls if you want toShares so shorts can\u2019t cover and we moon. Get bothCan you explain Gamma squeeze to someone who understands what gamma is but is too dumb to figure out why it squeezes and what the effects ?Idk about how premarket on RH works, but with my broker and I assume many  a premarket market order at open on a stock thats up premarket usually jumps a bit right at open and u get a worse price than the delayed data shows (from my experience). So I mean, if you already can start ordering at 9. Go with a limit order of a few percent above whatever is the price then. See if you can get in before open, if not then just blind it at open and YOLO. Again, I expect a small dip for sure to occur sometime after open like an hour or two in so I've decided to drop half at open and half ill day trade. But again with that thesis shouldn't matter at all tbh.In very simple terms. Market makers are forced to buy shares to balance their hedge. This occurs when there are huge changes in option markets which is what we have seen.Bro thank you, this is exactly the sort of information I was looking for. If this is the kind of retardation I can hope for from this sub then I am happy to join you.Thanks Bro",

If I just listened to the autists I would have doubled my money on market orders alone.Hold strong, GME holders. Shorts were sweating at $25. Now at >$36 they're completely fucked.

Like do you use a specific app, what\u2019s the difference between stocks/calls etc? Wouldn\u2019t mind throwing a few quid in but have zero fucking idea how to get startedI have 30/c that expires tomorrow. I missed the 38 mark today so was hoping it hits 38 again so I can sell the option. You think we getting there again today.... tomorrow!?Someone is buying over 200k shares at 36.gg boiz bought a bunch of calls and then $14.23 of shares with my leftoversMelvin Capital?

Now I have 200% original money to buy yolo calls.I hopped off the GME train to get on the BB train, but will be enjoying my tendies tonight watching this movie.This should be right on the front page of wallstreetbets WE ARE NOT PLAYING \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80I'm a high functioning autist, some of the math was offThis is WSB Perfection\ud83d\udc4cu/savevideoTuesday\u2019s mark to market is going to be painful for Melvin, they will have to bring in fresh capital to cover their losses or buy to cover, this ain\u2019t over. House call if they dip below 35% and an immediate exchange call at 25% equity. They might be able to stretch it out but they will have to sell something to cover or bring in more trendies.I don't own any GME but these meme are something else\ud83d\ude02My favorite movie and scene of all time.yo i bought at 38 does that mean 0% for me then??GME gang welcomes every bagholder \ud83d\udcbcShould i go in with a leverage x2 maybe just to get as many shares as possible?Wait, is Melvin winning? What is going on? Retreat?We're all selling at open and using the gains for more PLTR?First of all it's Macedonians in English and Makedones in Greek(-lish). Makedonians doesn't exist.\n\nThey were considered savages by the Athenians just like the Athenians were considered boy lovers by the Spartans. City states weren't in the best of terms at the time and political rivalry between them doesn't change their ethnic composition. Theyre all descendants of the same tribes give or take, speak the same language and believe in the same cultural traditions.\n\nMoreover, Philip was actually from Argos.May I ask why are people doing this considering all the news around game stop and where the company is actually headingCan you make a part 2 of this meme where that paper hand cripple ass mf leads the Persians behind the Spartans? Cause that's going down rnIs someone gonna post the scene after this?Y\u2019all know how this movie ends right?I mean I like it but you do know how that movie ended right?Lol don\u2019t they all die in the end?I finally bought in.  THis shit better do something!!!Wow the short squeeze last two days\n\nYou did it boyztake my survey u fuckers \n\nhttps://forms.gle/yMHg75RNn9ggipet7Can some one explain to an idiot like me what\u2019s going on with Melvin capital?Not gonna lie WSB scares me sometimes. Seems the whole point is to lead this sub off of cliffs. The short term gains are glorious but I can\u2019t see any future this stock doesn\u2019t crash after the artificial bubble pops. I like your style tho. That shit is cute.Can someone explain what happened here? Why is it up 100% in 2 days?Don\u2019t... don\u2019t the Spartans lose at the end \ud83e\udd7aUmmm, doesn't this end bad for us?Someone explain I'm stupidDon't we all die at the end tho...FUCK MELVIN GME YOLO GANG\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Ugh!

He told the tale1. You get a broker. Fund your account. If you're only using \"a few quid,\" then you'll want a discount broker like Robinhood. (Not sure what's available in the UK.)\n2. If you want to get involved in \"this sort of thing\" (i.e., what WSB does), just pick stocks you think will shoot up and buy some short-term call options. You need an options account to do that. Basically, you'll want to figure out how to calculate the leverage of positions you're considering (\\[delta \\* stock price\\] / call price). More is better if you think it will shoot up.\n3.

They will bleed this week!I'm waiting for it to dip a little more, but I liquidated this morning so that I could double down on GME at the right moment too.YesThey want things to be one way\n\nBut it's the other wayI want an ELI5 too. I have no vested interest but i can't see how GME can sustain long term as a business. Why the did the wsb collective decide it's a battle worth fighting?\n\nEdit: nm, this post explained plenty\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kx5wu9/fuck_melvin_capitalSeriously, no one could have summed up this feud better than you just did.  \ud83d\udcaf \ud83d\udd25Never piss off the internet.

Do you own workShhhhh don\u2019t use that word it\u2019s just about memes rememberIt\u2019s a meme to buy GME, not manipulation jeez, that\u2019s boomer talk we millennials and Gen z up in this shitNo, this is using the rules of the game against the elite who used sketchy mechanisms to sell more of something than actually existed to screw over average investors.  They sold more GME shares than they could technically own.  One of ours saw a cheap company and is making something good out of it and we are in it because it makes more sense to us than the garbage reports Citron or Hindenberg put out.  Those guys are market manipulators.No.  \u201cSqueezing\u201d an over sold short actually brings the stock to a more fair market balance. \n\n\nSelling more shares of a company than the number of shares that exist is potentially manipulation and does not help the market come to a fair valuation.  \n\n\nThe argument is that they essentially diluted the fair market value by over selling the shares.  \n\n\nSo, it\u2019s a free market righting itself, by saying \u201coh if those are worth $x diluted, then when the dilution is removed they should be worth more\u201d.  It\u2019s math. It\u2019s free market.  \n\n\nTo stop that, or regulate buying over shorted stocks, would be diminishing the free market.  Which is the opposite goal of financial regulation.Its quite literally notStrictly speaking\n\nProbablySomeone said that Melvin Capital increased their short position[https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=GME&submit=Short+Quote%E2%84%A2](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=GME&submit=Short+Quote%E2%84%A2)  \n\n\napparently this is delayed 20 mins. Also noticed about 40k calls disappeared off the market when price hit $42.

Although that battleship one slipped into one of my all time favorites.How long of a call do you recommend?Thanks for the information! How far out do you recommend I buy the call?Extremely, last I checked everyone was laughing at those who grasped to their GME stonksSo that your broker cannot lend your shares for shorting without your permission.

Also, Alexander the great burned Persepolis down to the ground in revenge years later. In the end, hedge funds will learn to fear the memes of WSB and think twice before naked short selling and manipulating our stocks.Well because Im chickening out a little I only purchased 3, 2 20$ puts February 19, 1 GME 24 put.

Us seeing an overextended fund, engaged with an even shadier insitutions behind them, capitalizing on them is not illegal.  That's savvy.\n\nWhen stated institutions are *naked short selling* shares that *don't exist*, sir, that is illegal.  Of course, its already been mathematically proven beyond a reasonable doubt that is exactly what they were doing, so, at that point, they squeezed the shit out of themselves.  *Of course* they were going to get long squeezed by the same autistic retards as well.  Why the hell not?  Those options were juicy as shit.  Unlike them, the people selling those calls *are covered by shares and/or cash*.  The callers don't have to borrow anything.  So you can see a scenario, where someone like me, whom sees a situation where I can literally make 10% return *of my entire portfolio* in two god damned days *with little to no risk* who has a fuckton of capital selling .  Well, you can see where those call sellers are coming from.  Besides the shorts pathetically to unload -20k puts in a way that doesn't get them prosecuted/bankrupt, you got us, the *savvy* ones gobbling up literal *tens of thousands of shares* to turnaround.\n\nThat all adds up to a squeeze.  That is simple market dynamics.  But, the important part, is *who was doing the illegal thing that led to perversion that led to this situation*.  That sir, is the insitutions who were naked short selling.  Feel free to report 'em to the SEC.  Most of us already did.... how dumb can a company be?  They are facing off against not only 1.8m autist, but also any trading firm that secretly watches us from the  shadows.So I think that means somebody was selling calls (another way to short a stock), but seemingly bought up the volume to close that position out (this demand spiked the price). Basically, it means the short squeeze if fully on because the shorts are starting to flip.Nvm, for some reason, Indians cannot invest in US derivatives. FML no tendies for me.\n\nI hope Dalal street is as wild as Wall Street.You will, because it's happening. \nGod i love i discovered gambling - Mondays are my favourite days. Sunday's could always go duck themselves (before and after i discovered \"investing\")Spread the word! Now there's at least two of us xDIt\u2019s up to you. Don\u2019t take financial advice from this sub.\n\nBasically the rule of thumb is not to invest money you can\u2019t stand to lose. Stocks are always safer because you can exit before things get really bad, aka you lose money but not all of it.Cannot give advice on timing. It depends on your own circumstances.IV is one of the metrics used to price options. GME IV is insanely high so premium is expensive. If IV comes down the premium will be much lower and you may not make gains even if the price moves in your favor.It means buy callsHey, on the plus side, that means you've survived ten years in this game. That's no mean feat!Not for longIt ends with their outcasts retard betraying them.[deleted]bruh the poetryAnd also as many shares as you can.

Which is not necessarily a lossNot that many new ratings thoughCut the cord and buy GME to holdGame stop is failing as a company.

I was there not too long ago... you see... \n\nBack in November I noticed $BB cleanly up-trending on the hourly bouncing off the 9 and 26 MA (I use ichimoku) heading towards a resistance level that had already formed a double top \n\nLike a true Gamblers fallacy believing retard I made a wager: \n\n$10k into $6 calls expiring March on the DD that: \u201cwhat are the chances it falls AGAIN there\u201d ... that\u2019s it. \n\nA few days later AWS news came, and that $10k turned into $70k. Pure luck. Sometimes she goes, sometimes she doesn\u2019t. She went that day.\n\nIn that moment of seeing massive profits on AWS news day, I experienced violent and absolutely tremendous autism and thought, this thing is going from $5\u2019s to $15 in a single trading session, yes, even more retarded than you guys that bought the top on Friday \n\nSensible thoughts couldn\u2019t penetrate my helmet fast enough as drool gushed from my gaping mouth, gasping for oxygen and yelling at the top of my lungs what barely resembled words about Lambo\u2019s and Yachts... so I hurled about $100k into shares at $8.77 and about $10k more into $15 leaps \n\nI proceeded to watch my profit dwindle to nothing as earnings came and bent me over so hard I couldn\u2019t bring myself to watch the stock for a week \n\nI thought about selling the bottom, I was there, order ready typed, just needed to hit the send button, and I was going to close my position around $6.7ish and be back to break even after striking gold \n\nBut you know what, I remembered it\u2019s just money. I remembered that everything in reality is in flux, and changing, and decaying, and being born again, and to just flow with it and stop clinging and desiring one set of experiences over another (aka a fat bank account over giving $5 blowies behind a Wendy\u2019s) who cares? \n\nAll is well lads. So let go of the burden if you bought the top and are stressing, it\u2019s really fine. Look at what\u2019s happening right now:\n\n1) Insane volume, insane moves, erratic behavior (something is going on behind the curtain) \n\nPS: this movement and volume is NOT because of WSB, full stop. Big players are making huge moves here, and fast, we don\u2019t know why yet \n\n2) 1 Billion annual revenue \n\n3) Soon to come online a RECURRING AUTO DATA business that will drive revenue into growth cycle, BB is literally Microsoft Windows for cars but the auto sector was still underdeveloped technologically to benefit from this position, hence this vertical is finally about to print HUGE HUGE HUGE MEGA BILLIONS ANNUAL. This was always the plan and they just had to wait it out until the auto sector caught up with them digitally \n\n(The auto data tech sector is so lucrative it made Papa Elon the richest person in the world, and forced a fucking god damn phone company to join the race \ud83c\udf4e\u2014it\u2019s huge)\n\n4) UNDER, FUCKING, VALUED \n\n5) VERTICALS GALORE\n\n5) FB settled, imagine the BALLS on BB going after this massive and dirty tech behemoth run by a literal lizard, they are honest Canadians doing God\u2019s work \n\n6) IOT, AI, smart city\u2019s, insert other buzzwords \n\nI could go on and on, and honestly, I\u2019ve never felt more comfortable holding ANY stock than this \n\nMoral of the story: as I let go and accepted my circumstances and decided to diamond hand \ud83d\udc8e \ud83e\udd1a BB to the death, within a few days I proceeded to watch the fattest, thickest, randomest, greenest dildo penetrate my butt hole to the high heavens and take me from what was $70k profit to 0 profit back up to $130k profit. I\u2019ve trimmed half the options, I don\u2019t even know why tbh, reverse autism maybe, but I\u2019m riding my remaining calls and entire share position to Valhalla. \n\nWill likely add more if it dips. But...\n\nJust hold. Something is cooking on BB. You have to be a retard not to see it. Look at the fucking daily chart, look at the volume, the gaps, the swings, BB chart literally has Tourette\u2019s syndrome right now... \n\nThis stock has not moved like this for 10 years. \n\nIt might stall a little, deflate from here, consolidate a bit more, or it might blast off again any second. Point is, nobody knows when, but it looks like in a short time, we will know why this stock is moving the way it has. Something is DEFINITELY going on behind the scenes the public is not aware of and neither is the media \n\nFor fucks sake I found the court docs showing global settlement with FB is done 24 hours before gay ass Bloomberg even picked it up. The majority of the investor world still thinks they make fucking phones for Gods sake. Everyone is sleeping on this \n\nA note on Jim just in case he reads this:\n\nJim Cramer hates this stock because 1) BB and John Chen are not bootlicking CEO\u2019s jerking off CNBC and massaging Cramers asshole for air time, they\u2019re a tightly run, honorable company doing real things 2) He most likely became a bag holder during the epic fall of the BB phone and sold for a fat loss and wants to protect his ego by continuing to ignore the facts on the company\n\nThe guy wants you to invest in CRWD with a fucking ridiculous market cap, no verticals, and less revenue than BB. Promoting a literal bubble over a value play. What a bizarre world we live in. Take advantage of it, I hear this phrase all the time and I fucking hate it, but this is literally \u201cfree money\u201d \n\nKnow what you own. There is TRUE value in this company. No hype. Pure value. \n\nDiamond hand, double down, buy more, and just hold. You are in good hands \ud83d\ude4c\n\nTl;dr diamond hand $BB",

Got shares and sold some CC's at the top.Preach. Bought DEEP ITM calls 6/2021 Friday at close cuz IV is bonkersI read all of this. Made me Happier.You couldn't be more correct. Eveything there is to find about this company is awesome, yet it's only at 5.5B market cap. \n\nThe volume is weird imo too, as well as us wsb'ers randomly picking it up roughly at the same time. I agree that this volume can't be us. There is however quite a probable explanation: BB came in the media a couple of times with positive news: Amazon partnership (huh wait what BB is in another industry than phones; EV's?!), Patent selling (huh wait what BB no longer sells phones?!), Facebook settlement (huh wait what BB no longer sells phones and has balls of steel?!)\n\nPeople are realising it's no longer the very good phone company that lost market share, it's now the very good company that does cybersecurity and is part of the EV supply chain.Sir, this is the unemployment line.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*Bought 2/19 16c. Is that more reasonable and realistic?Already own 47 shares, will buy more if it dips again next week \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80NiO to the moon after this dip. Tuesday bb and NiO takeoff \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 GME has me sus.Onboard with you captain \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8eThanks for your condolences and advices. I\u2019m all in and down $11,000 already also I owe the IRS $4,000 for my imaginary gains in 2020 (just lost all my 2020 gains). BB will soar or my life is over! I will not sell!!!!!!!!!1/22 11c reporting for dutyBB isn't your usual one night stand ****. She is marriage material. That's why you need diamonds hands \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50Stay strong brothers. It's getting the attention from bigger players, finally. BB was trying to implement synergies with the Cylance acquisition. People are arguing the CEO has done nothing so far with Cylance. Whoever thinks you can successfully create synergies under 1-2 year without hiccups and burning through some cash is a retarded analyst. Plus the synergies are finally working out, and the hiccups are going away. This is primed for growth. Give it time and it will moon... No it will fucking leave this universe.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80I didn't read anything... just skipped to the bottom and saw \"diamond hand $BB\"... that made sense... so buying more on Tuesday open!3 rocket minimum.What are your options gonna be?Good Lord, somebody get this man a stool so he can safely step off the short bus\n\nMost likely I would exchange those for leaps... BUT... I can honestly see those printing if you wanna gamblethats autism to a new level...Bought into NIO on a whim at 2am because my friend said the same thing lets go to the moon \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

Jacked to the tits on pltrI\u2019ve been on this train since the direct listing and I\u2019m not fucking getting off!! I\u2019ve been adding shares when it dips towards $20 and calls when I\u2019m feeling spicy. MagiKarp make me rich. \n\nIn all seriousness I truly believe in the company. I work at a very data heavy F50 that has massive BI teams and spends a fuck ton on data warehousing, and it\u2019s still a complete mess. There\u2019s a massive B2B market on top of the government/military market. I also am firmly behind Palantirs ideals and think it\u2019s really refreshing for a company to stand up for what they believe in so loudly.Bruh I don\u2019t even understand stocks but I can tell this post is qualityI believe it will go up again because otherwise it would mean that I made a mistakewhy is it going down i want my free moneyNot going to lie have been skeptical on stocks mentioned here. But after doing my own DD and the comments made by Alex about his focus, he sounds a lot like musk. Laser focused only on work.Is Tom Hanks a retard?I feel like this should have some eurobeat in the background. \n\n*eurobeat intensifies*\n\n*Edit Watched this on mute didn't realize it already had Runnin' in the 90s.\n\nPLTR \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80I'm really pissed this didn't happen last week.The Palantir Express!

We understand that hard work isn't the key to success, marketing yourself and your product is.\n\nIt was a lot easier to get ahead in a world that had less rules and regulations.\n\nMusk is in a tech that the competition is trying to catch, much like smaller software companies that completed with Gates. Alex is doing the same thing in his field. Mark. Z. The examples are countless.\n\nWill competition pop up? sure. But I'll ride the train up as long as possible in the mean time.\n\nMusk may have fun, but hey he's a richer guy than you or me: so he did something right. He called his own company put plenty of times, and I think that also helped fuel his success. Boomers taught younger generations to \"always tell the truth\" which was bullshit and why they hate them, but for those rare people who always speak it they become a type of god in their eyes.\n\nOr it's all bullshit and we are living in the worst simulation ever.He\u2019s laser focused because of the pot.Elon Musk is insanely laser focused.  He sleeps on the floor of SpaceX.  He smoked pot once because the god of podcasting pushed it on him and he's too much of a bad ass to say no.. didn't even look like he inhaled.  Sure he's got a ton of other things in the fire like Tesla, Boring, Solar Roofs, etc. but he's doing insanely well there too.  \n\nMusk is King.But his wife is Canadian?yet MS products sucks and tesla makes far superior products.He started a rocket company and a car company. Two of the hardest industries to break in to. Meanwhile Gates built DOS and basic when the soil was fertile for such innovation. \n\nElon definitely worked hard to get where he is, if you think otherwise you\u2019re a fool.Bro your literally a boomer. Sorry.FUCK[I'm gonna be honest](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/028/956/Joe_Rogan_Experience__1255_-_Alex_Jones_Returns!_3-24-49_screenshot.png)He's pushing on the certain brakes.

This aint fuckin doordash\n\nThis is very true - and I  totally agree. If doordash is worth THAT, then Palantir is worth at least 40.Yes, but the point still stands: Boomers are learning they can't deny the power of memes.But chasing 100 baggers will make you rich!I'm bullish, its why I raised it to 32$ this week, last 3 weeks have been for 30$.Or jerking off homeless guys for a cheeseburgerRemind me!  14 monthsMemes aside, do I buy some of this horse shit?I tried to short the high on GME USING FDs. That was a miserable experience. My entry was perfect but it bounced back to my entry price and they were down $2000.  They\u2019re so unpredictable lolI agree man but I still need enough time for them to print. Don\u2019t wanna give all my tendies to r/thetagang. \n\nMy options usually expire worthless and the stock moons the day after.When I first joined this sub (2 months), I didn\u2019t know these types of comments were jokes. Can we start putting /s on this type of stuff.Here in Europe we can\u2019t access ARKK or ARKW or ARKanything- should I just buy some of these stocks as they\u2019re all cool and futuristic, which means they\u2019ll always go to the moonTO THE HOOHObviously not :)\n\nIn other words\n\n\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80Yes it is>\tIt was a lot easier to get ahead in a world that had less rules and regulations\n\nlmao. right, it\u2019s just that musk has taken billions of taxpayer money to support his companies.There is one man in common amongst the 3 modern names you dropped, and he literally wrote the book on the strategy you\u2019re describing. Do you know who he is?No doubt he's made a lot of things right. I believe he's the prime example of the right person, at the right place at the right time.  Had he tried to popularise EVs a few years earlier (like many other did), he would be almost guaranteed to fail. Same with SpaceX.  There's a saying that luck is the meeting between an opportunity and someone prepared for it. \n\nRegarding the whole iconoclastic cult-figure market technique, its a remarkable feature of our times and fortunately one that I believe is nearing its end. Prior to him was Jobs and prior to that, Gates (which was also a controversial figure back in the 90s).>We understand that hard work isn't the key to success, marketing yourself and your product is.\n\nIf you ask TSLA bros, hes revolutionizing the entire industry.He moved HQ to Denver, where shrooms are now decriminalized.Even though no one can make a diagnosis based on someone's public figure alone, it's fair to say there's a high probability he does meet the criteria for Bipolar disorder and/or ADHD. \n\nIf that's the case, he probably does have periods of hyper focus, but they're probably mixed with lots of periods of very low focus and a very high optimism and very low frustration threshold.  These things have certainly contributed to his success, coupled with the necessary intellect and resources.  \n\nNow that maybe a winning combination now, but it's certainly a liability on the long run, as he may eventually jeopardize the company by pushing ahead less productive ideas.His wife agreed to name their kid a bunch of nonsense. You think she cares about the hooker?Guess I'm too autistic to understand comparing software to cars and batteries.What\u2019s funny is that Gates bought his first operating system and marketed it better than the guy who invented it, and these kids have no idea.\n\nGo watch Pirates of Silicon Valley y\u2019all.Clench so hard you barf?I think Elon's antagonism is a strength. When Tesla first started reputable car mag's were purposely draining the battery and giving Tesla false reviews. Although Tesla vehicles did have some issues not sure if that is the case going forward.Show me one instance where I said he didn't work hard? A lot of people work very hard in this world, probably harder than both Gates and Musk. Hard work is definitely a prerequisite for this kind of success, but definitely not the only one.Look it up lol he didn't start Tesla. He became a major funder 2 years after it startedI was in 500\u20ac and felt every bump. I guess I'm turning, because I pumped a little more in at every dip totaling now 3.5k\u20ac and I dont feel anything anymore.

During the last four quarters, there were at least forty (40) trades; and\nb. During each of the last four (4) quarters, there was at least one (1) trade; and\nc. The total notional value of the top forty (40) trades of the last four (4) quarters is greater than EUR 200,000; and\nd.

I dont suppose to know more about space travel than he does,  but I've seen interviews with astronomers arguing that we're on the brink of over saturating earth's orbit with debris. That could lead to a chain reaction where a single colision would generate thousands of smaller debris and thus far, other colision. In this scenario, theory goes, space travel would become impossible, as we would be trapped on earth.  \n\nIn light of that, he would be sabotaging his dream with his satellite constellation. \n\nPS: there might be some technical details regarding his satellites orbit height, but if I remember it correctly,  it's not consensual whether those orbits would make it safe.Did you forget he called a freaking thai rescue diver a pedo?

Can you explain would you would call a child a hooker? If he is a pedo, he would be raping children, not buying hookers. Makes me think you're the one projecting.

Look it up, we really are very close to the point of no return, if science is to be believed.  Plus, seems counterproductive to be littering space when that's the kind of thing that's ruining our environment in earth in the first place.Wont fall into that troll trap ,mate. I only post here because I only use reddit for this sub.Thanks fellow autist, I'm all in\n\nYou had me at \"revolutionary\"When you copy the pie, just have a check through and you can edit the 0, just make sure EDIT, TSLA etc. are at 0%. I feel like this is really obvious information but my retarded ass wasn\u2019t paying attention.You can interpret my legitimate question to trolling all you want. I'm going to stand by the fact that you associated being a pedo with Thai Hookers, when children are not hookers, they are kidnapped. That's what you've left behind. Typically when I call these things out, people delete their posts. I hope you don't so we can get a history of what you've said. Maybe that will help you be more careful about your accusations.Chill man. I'm not the one making actual public accusations about people being paedophiles. This is a fucking subreddit where people call themselves autists and retards and make jokes about their wifes boyfriends.  Stop trying to make an argument for the sake of it (trolling).",

Judging by her picture, I doubt this girl has many interactions with men in general.He runs a fortune 500 company. He literally controls over a BN in annual revenue and has like 37k employees who depend on his company to feed their families. And he spends his free time shitposting with some random guy pretending to be the planet mars on twitter. \n\nIts uplifting because this proves any autist off the street can achieve great success in america. Then it's also very very very concerning that people like me are running things. ahem.. elon chanReminder that this man's space company built a more powerful rocket than NASA in 1/3 of the time with 10% of the budget. Elon\u2019s gonna land on mars first just so he can stick his dick in itSince SpaceX isn't public you can't invest in it. Luckily Alphabet (Google's parent company) has a 7.5% cut in SpaceX, so you could invest in that if you think you're gonna get like 40,000% return, which if Elon Chan makes it to Mars is quite possible in my humble opinion.I thought girls go to Jupiter to get more stupider, no? The only two things Elon does in the world is work and shitpost.

'Men are from mars'This is the one of tbe most unexpected tweets ever from someone with space money\n\nI guess that's why every memer likes elonHere is what you will need for a elonmusk-fact-checker-bot I think \n\n- Python\n- Python reddit api wrapper PRAW (respond to mentions, to download image, and reply)\n- Image transcription library like pytessaract (to transcribe the image content)\n- extract the tweet\n- twitter api access using something like python-twitter (to search and confirm the tweet, copy URL)\n- upon confirmation reply the URL using PRAW\n- host the bot in cloud, vps, or in a local host and set up a  cronjob.Every comment is the same from the last is this a real Elon tweet.

Not nudes.My fiance is sitting here confused as to why that woman would want to go to Mars at all... For this reason. HahahahaI'm sure she is thrilled with the harassment she no doubt has received after all this. Her Twitter has been deleted. I feel bad for her. She was probably just trying to vent about something stupid and this happened. [deleted]Yeah but he still gotta take a shit man, these are prob toliet tweetsWhat are you gonna do, just lose your sense of humor once you get successful?

If NASA still had any kind of budget they'd still be pushing the envelope \"Only the Saturn V moon rocket, last flown in 1973, delivered more payload to orbit than Falcon Heavy.\"\nhttps://www.spacex.com/falcon-heavy\n\nIts been 50 years since NASA started development of Saturn V. I'd attribute any cost reduction to advancements in information technology, as well as not having to reinvent the wheel. Unless you are talking about a different rocket.Yeah but Elon can use pre-existing technology as a basis for his rockets. NASA had to do R&D on every single system and aspect nearly from scratchFirst man to cum on MarsAlphabet isn't Google's parent company, it's literally Google with the name changed.Sure is buddy, just going with the what news is going around, even more so coz it's bezosI'm so sorry you're so miserable and insecure that you feel the need to say such awful things about people. I'm genuinely sorry. I hope you find some happiness. She made the original tweet. She has now deleted herself from Twitter because of all the harassment she received. People like you are the reason. If you treat someone poorly for how they look, they tend to not like you. Men are from Mars, women are from Venus.  This is common Sci fi knowledge boisLooks like someone won't be going to mars.He's technically the oldest he's ever been at this exact moment.  I'm fond of this old Elon.banI mean, it's possible he was projecting but I kinda want to see evidence first.This is the exact opposite of what happens, lolIn-depth research shows TSLA performance is positively correlated to the frequency of Elon shitposts. \n\nIf you think he\u2019s shitposting a lot now, you really should check the week of Oct 24, 2018, or from late 2012 to mid 2013.\n\nAnd Elon jacks off to it. [No I'm not kidding.](https://mobile.twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1094027558235058182)Actually, I think he may have been in Europe when he texted this.  Close to Amsterdam.Gads.Well, I can'tHello VsauceMusk 2020If even 0.01% of Elon's followers decided to harass her, that would be almost 2,500 people.  Not a huge surprise.[deleted]in a weird wayIt isn't?you all have seen his old pictures right?  This shouldn't be any surpriseI'm sorry but Monty Python friggin sucks.  British humor is so stupid.So long.

It's clear you idiots are too maladjusted to moderate yourselves in any fashion. Lol he got a fucking planet nippleAre there hotter pics than nude ones?Lesson learned: don\u2019t say 50% of the population shouldn\u2019t exist. They had us in the first half not gonna lie>People like me\n\nI mean autistic shitposters who frequently get into nonsense internet arguments with strangers. Why? I've accomplished more than Elon as wellDont forget control about where to spend the money.> If NASA still had any kind of budget\n\nNASA has been reciving 65% of Apollo era funding since 1973.\nThey just spend this on buying stuff like 200mil$/unit 1970s rocket engines Not at the same speed though. It being part of the government means that progress is slowed by all the red tape.Could be talking about the still ongoing development of SLS which is over-budget and over-schedule. Don't know the exact numbers, though. SLS is much more comparable to Starship, tho, and that thing is not done yet.\n\nEDIT: There was also the Ares rocket that was cancelled once it became obvious that private launch providers would be more efficient in orbital launches than NASA.I was talking about the BFR or whatever he calls it vs the rocket NASA has been building for a decade called Orion. They are allocated billions every year for it's development and every year it seems to be 4 years away from completion. We need another war if we want NASA to be innovative or else space you be left to the private industry. I'm not sure, but I was under the impression that we don't actually have good records of how the Saturn V was built, so they may actually have been re-engineering the wheel.\n\nThis isn't really to argue with your point, just what I thought. Yeah and those guys did it with pen and paper like literally doing all calculations by hand. Not anymore they are in unknown land with BFR for the most of the systemsNASA helped Hollywood not the space industry. [deleted]Yes and no. Basically Alphabet became corporate owner of Google, but also took on Google's subsidiaries (Wayno, Deepmind etc), making google the company souly google stuff. I hope that made sense, it's kinda confusing.Twitter truly is a sick and toxic place that brings out the worst in everyone. > Boys go to Mars to get more candy bars.\n>\n> Girls go to Jupiter to get more stupider.\n\nThus spake Zarathustra. And it was known.Billionaires publicly sexting with planetary objects. This is truly the dankest timelines.Wait so how many of those crazy ass Elon tweets that pop up all over reddit are real? I genuinely thought all of them plus this would be photoshoppedJesus ChristThis is the kind of DD I'm looking for. That's it, I'm all in on TSLA. God bless Elon. Truly we live in the best timeline I was born in the upmost perferct generation I cannot thank my parents or the universe enough this is a beautiful time to be alive [321 blast off](https://twitter.com/ZainRaz4/status/1094028067981443072?s=20) Wtf it's like Trump, I hear these ridiculous things and think it's a joke, but it's real I don't even know what's real anymoreThe legend.ok what the fuckI would play DnD with Elon.

That's pretty awesome. Elon is turning into John McAffee. Dude is straight up crazy and I love it.Hey, at least he's not presidentAt least he's not calling anyone a pedo, I guess. Ok so we can blame this one on the ambien According to Americans anywhere in Europe is close to Amsterdam.Good enough for me. Who says noHe\u2019s been flying like a son of a bitch lately. It\u2019s technically work but he\u2019s got some time to tweetMore like 420 hours a week... am I right? Am I left??He\u2019s been asked about this actually. He says he tweets primarily during \u201cinterstitial periods\u201d like taking a taking a dump. Literally shitposting.He doesn't actually tweet that much. Until everybody climaxes. YESSITTISSBring forth the Holy Hand Grenade!First of all, how dare you? Fawlty Towers is the GOAT thoI thought the same thing until I watched it high. Never laughed so hard. But, that is what it took. \n\nI can only imagine how funny Dr. Who is while high. ...added to to-do list. Cancel this.

You're the one who's stupid. Literally the shauncore guy said a couple days ago that a middle ground between shit posts and DD is most desirable. If this post were false, it would be a very funny shit posts and definitely not worth removing. Calling me an idiot and maladjusted to moderate myself is completely uncalled for. Being a mod for an online forum has really gotten to your head.ThermostatCalifornia wildfire damage to PCG put holders?Pam's art[deleted]Unless your Bill Gates I really doubt that Compared to how we used to spend money it gets less https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget_of_NASA#/media/File:NASA-Budget-Federal.svg and I think the budget suffers from lack of focus becuase of not having specific goals to work towards like we did in the space raceThe government can also dump resources into research exploration knowing it's good for society long term without having to worry about quarterly reportsIs that the thing that got blown over during a storm?Sort of. Each Saturn V ended up being unique, and the supply chain was so complex that once they were no longer produced it would require revisiting R&D in order to replicate. We have the plans, it's just that the plans would require us to establish tens of billions in infrastructure, and wouldn't be exact to any Saturn V that had ever flown. Additionally many of the original manufacturers for parts are dead or out of business.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think the thread OP was referring to either Orion or SLS compared to Falcon Heavy, not Saturn V. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: TypoYou\u2019re an idiot *insideGrab them by the Pluto.2018 was pretty crazy.

Kinda makes me wanna \ud83e\udd5c tbhEh, it was better 30-40 years ago when we only had Vietnam, nuclear war and the population bomb to worry abouti mean, it's all a joke.

I'm American but I know geography.

Do you not realize this is /r/wallstreetbets  and not /r/memes? omegalulThe above post is idiotic and maladjusted. Gotta say that I agree with you. There's been a recent shift in this sub for the worse, which most people are blaming on the subreddit expanding, but I think it's really caused by shitty mods power tripping.Oh baby. Show me your water pump gasket. That\u2019s why I love people like Kanye, Trump, and Elon regardless of if I believe in their ideas. I love that no matter how much wealth, power, and influence they have, they\u2019re still true to themselves.You say that sarcastically but it *is weird*. It\u2019s very unusual. Many celebrities do not usually even tweet themselves and if they do, their profiles are usually professional/promotional. Billionaires (or really anyone who is accountable to shareholders) even more so. \n\nI get that his public persona probably helps Tesla as a brand/stock but he can keep that persona without shitposts. Elon will argue with people with 0 followers who @mention him. He clearly finds it fun and doesn\u2019t give a fuck about potential consequences.But I do crossfit so technically I'm a Chad and musk is a virgin\n\nBill Gates by comparison is such a dweeb he shoots ovum while jacking offTake a look at absolute amount you have a table just on the page you linkedYeah, but it's they don't really sorry we about doing stuff quickly unless they're in a war.No, the thing that got blown over is like a dummy shell/mass-drag simulant to test autonomous landing and Raptor engine thrust profile for the Starship. The test hopper is called Starhopper; it's like rapid prototyping. The SLS is NASAs interplanetary/super-heavy launch vehicle that's been in development for about 10 years.Gotcha, that makes sense. How can you land on the moon when it's obviously a flat hologram?And when you're an astronaut, they let you do it. There's a joke about your anus in there somewhere.

Go get it for me sonnyIf it was false it\u2019s just another low effort fake tweet. It\u2019s hilarious because Elon actually tweeted about jacking off to a pic of a Mars nipple.I would've gone with evict yourself, either/or, still an improvement for this sub. DD you find online in a public forum is always going to be shit. People aren't going to share quality pitches because wtf would they gain, and also NDAs.

Every shape is a square. Mind blown./u/vredditshareOkay, what did I actually miss here?This sub is a pyramid scheme.Stop it. Get some help...Hey /u/SophieOfMacklenburg could you share a source for this clip please? :)what no $TSLA ?This is the most retarded thing i have seen today, and im not even shockedI bought $10,000 worth of  Pltr when it first opened. Didn't know anything about it. Just came across it on the discord chat. Got it at just under $11. The plan was for a quick profit (I'm new to investing). It dipped down to $10 and I panicked and sold. Lost like $700 (or something like that) in like 30 mins. I definitely regret not sticking it out. But I took what I lost, went the safe route and diversified. But I can still be WSB gang right?Did the palantir lock up period and last week?  Was that why it hit a bottom January 4th? And are we on our way up? And will demo day January 26th matter?  About $3,000 in options wondering if I need to go up on that or pull my money outI threw all my life savings in PLTR. I have 9500 shares.  \nDon't be pussies.STOP SPENDING MONEY ON AWARDS AND BUY THE SHARES!Great pep talk , all in on $SQDiversification is for democrats.Every red dAy is just a discounted ticket to mars!I also choose this guys square hole.square hole!What hole does the \ud83d\ude80 go in?IQ 100000This hits too close to homePLTR = surveillance, big data, AI, cybersecurity, intel, international , commercial and US customers.

If I just listened to the autists I would have doubled my money on market orders alone.Hold strong, GME holders. Shorts were sweating at $25. Now at >$36 they're completely fucked.

Wouldn\u2019t mind throwing a few quid in but have zero fucking idea how to get startedI have 30/c that expires tomorrow. I missed the 38 mark today so was hoping it hits 38 again so I can sell the option.

Now I have 200% original money to buy yolo calls.I hopped off the GME train to get on the BB train, but will be enjoying my tendies tonight watching this movie.This should be right on the front page of wallstreetbets WE ARE NOT PLAYING \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80I'm a high functioning autist, some of the math was offThis is WSB Perfection\ud83d\udc4cu/savevideoTuesday\u2019s mark to market is going to be painful for Melvin, they will have to bring in fresh capital to cover their losses or buy to cover, this ain\u2019t over. House call if they dip below 35% and an immediate exchange call at 25% equity. They might be able to stretch it out but they will have to sell something to cover or bring in more trendies.I don't own any GME but these meme are something else\ud83d\ude02My favorite movie and scene of all time.yo i bought at 38 does that mean 0% for me then??GME gang welcomes every bagholder \ud83d\udcbcShould i go in with a leverage x2 maybe just to get as many shares as possible?Wait, is Melvin winning? What is going on? Retreat?We're all selling at open and using the gains for more PLTR?First of all it's Macedonians in English and Makedones in Greek(-lish). Makedonians doesn't exist.\n\nThey were considered savages by the Athenians just like the Athenians were considered boy lovers by the Spartans. City states weren't in the best of terms at the time and political rivalry between them doesn't change their ethnic composition. Theyre all descendants of the same tribes give or take, speak the same language and believe in the same cultural traditions.\n\nMoreover, Philip was actually from Argos.May I ask why are people doing this considering all the news around game stop and where the company is actually headingCan you make a part 2 of this meme where that paper hand cripple ass mf leads the Persians behind the Spartans? Cause that's going down rnIs someone gonna post the scene after this?Y\u2019all know how this movie ends right?I mean I like it but you do know how that movie ended right?Lol don\u2019t they all die in the end?I finally bought in.  THis shit better do something!!!Wow the short squeeze last two days\n\nYou did it boyztake my survey u fuckers \n\nhttps://forms.gle/yMHg75RNn9ggipet7Can some one explain to an idiot like me what\u2019s going on with Melvin capital?Not gonna lie WSB scares me sometimes. Seems the whole point is to lead this sub off of cliffs. The short term gains are glorious but I can\u2019t see any future this stock doesn\u2019t crash after the artificial bubble pops. I like your style tho. That shit is cute.Can someone explain what happened here? Why is it up 100% in 2 days?Don\u2019t... don\u2019t the Spartans lose at the end \ud83e\udd7aUmmm, doesn't this end bad for us?Someone explain I'm stupidDon't we all die at the end tho...FUCK MELVIN GME YOLO GANG\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Ugh!

Are they some fund with short positions in GME and pissed off at the autistic conglomerate?Thank you for your service, Sir!this is the wayWhat happens then?Do itWell, there is something appealing about fucking over people that have without mercy buried people for money at some time or another.This is the way**someone please send this post to Gabriel Plotkin**\n\ntop kekI think it's more than that.

He told the tale1. You get a broker. Fund your account. If you're only using \"a few quid,\" then you'll want a discount broker like Robinhood. (Not sure what's available in the UK.)\n2. If you want to get involved in \"this sort of thing\" (i.e., what WSB does), just pick stocks you think will shoot up and buy some short-term call options. You need an options account to do that. Basically, you'll want to figure out how to calculate the leverage of positions you're considering (\\[delta \\* stock price\\] / call price). More is better if you think it will shoot up.\n3.

On top of that, yesterday was more of a \u201ccorrection\u201d than it was the fallout of us collectively fucking the Shorts. Stay in at least until then, and buy more shares if you can up until. \n\nAs far as PLTR goes, though...\n\n  NPR just this morning had a story about the biometrics the US Army has collected in nearly every encounter with a suspected/known insurgent. Fingerprints, DNA, known associations, all that shit.\n\nNow let me ask you: who do you think is managing all that data and doing the analytics for them, hmmmm? \n\nPLTR is an even longer play than GME, maybe even more profitable, but it won\u2019t be as sexy. We made history yesterday with GameStop. It\u2019s a wild success story, and you should be proud to be a part of it. Show that pride by buying more shares, and hold them until the Shorts are fucked into oblivion. Then we can focus on PLTR.\n\n#GMEgang\n\n**HOLD THE LINE**\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf16\ud83d\udc8e\u270bSelling 5 covered shorts, I hope I get assignedSold GME CC $25 1/15 for 2.50.

They held the pass long enough for war to be agreed upon and the army mustered.Shhfuck everyone who comes between us and our tendies and video games!!!All my homies hate Melvin.Strap your boots and put on your condoms cosmonauts we\u2019re going to the fucking moon some of you were going to ejaculate some of you were going to die but we will be legends for a life time!!!What did I do to you manDeepFuck MelvinYou got it at 24 this morning?

They will bleed this week!I'm waiting for it to dip a little more, but I liquidated this morning so that I could double down on GME at the right moment too.YesThey want things to be one way\n\nBut it's the other wayI want an ELI5 too. I have no vested interest but i can't see how GME can sustain long term as a business. Why the did the wsb collective decide it's a battle worth fighting?\n\nEdit: nm, this post explained plenty\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kx5wu9/fuck_melvin_capitalSeriously, no one could have summed up this feud better than you just did.  \ud83d\udcaf \ud83d\udd25Never piss off the internet.

Do you own workShhhhh don\u2019t use that word it\u2019s just about memes rememberIt\u2019s a meme to buy GME, not manipulation jeez, that\u2019s boomer talk we millennials and Gen z up in this shitNo, this is using the rules of the game against the elite who used sketchy mechanisms to sell more of something than actually existed to screw over average investors.  They sold more GME shares than they could technically own.  One of ours saw a cheap company and is making something good out of it and we are in it because it makes more sense to us than the garbage reports Citron or Hindenberg put out.  Those guys are market manipulators.No.  \u201cSqueezing\u201d an over sold short actually brings the stock to a more fair market balance. \n\n\nSelling more shares of a company than the number of shares that exist is potentially manipulation and does not help the market come to a fair valuation.  \n\n\nThe argument is that they essentially diluted the fair market value by over selling the shares.  \n\n\nSo, it\u2019s a free market righting itself, by saying \u201coh if those are worth $x diluted, then when the dilution is removed they should be worth more\u201d.  It\u2019s math. It\u2019s free market.  \n\n\nTo stop that, or regulate buying over shorted stocks, would be diminishing the free market.  Which is the opposite goal of financial regulation.Its quite literally notStrictly speaking\n\nProbablySomeone said that Melvin Capital increased their short position[https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=GME&submit=Short+Quote%E2%84%A2](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=GME&submit=Short+Quote%E2%84%A2)  \n\n\napparently this is delayed 20 mins.

Now the idea is to keep the stock as high as possible so they have to sell their shares at whatever the strike price is and the buyer makes bank.The quality of meme's here is absurd. Although that battleship one slipped into one of my all time favorites.How long of a call do you recommend?Thanks for the information! How far out do you recommend I buy the call?Extremely, last I checked everyone was laughing at those who grasped to their GME stonksSo that your broker cannot lend your shares for shorting without your permission.

Also, Alexander the great burned Persepolis down to the ground in revenge years later. In the end, hedge funds will learn to fear the memes of WSB and think twice before naked short selling and manipulating our stocks.Well because Im chickening out a little I only purchased 3, 2 20$ puts February 19, 1 GME 24 put.

Us seeing an overextended fund, engaged with an even shadier insitutions behind them, capitalizing on them is not illegal.  That's savvy.\n\nWhen stated institutions are *naked short selling* shares that *don't exist*, sir, that is illegal.  Of course, its already been mathematically proven beyond a reasonable doubt that is exactly what they were doing, so, at that point, they squeezed the shit out of themselves.  *Of course* they were going to get long squeezed by the same autistic retards as well.  Why the hell not?  Those options were juicy as shit.  Unlike them, the people selling those calls *are covered by shares and/or cash*.  The callers don't have to borrow anything.  So you can see a scenario, where someone like me, whom sees a situation where I can literally make 10% return *of my entire portfolio* in two god damned days *with little to no risk* who has a fuckton of capital selling .  Well, you can see where those call sellers are coming from.  Besides the shorts pathetically to unload -20k puts in a way that doesn't get them prosecuted/bankrupt, you got us, the *savvy* ones gobbling up literal *tens of thousands of shares* to turnaround.\n\nThat all adds up to a squeeze.  That is simple market dynamics.  But, the important part, is *who was doing the illegal thing that led to perversion that led to this situation*.  That sir, is the insitutions who were naked short selling.  Feel free to report 'em to the SEC.  Most of us already did.... how dumb can a company be?  They are facing off against not only 1.8m autist, but also any trading firm that secretly watches us from the  shadows.So I think that means somebody was selling calls (another way to short a stock), but seemingly bought up the volume to close that position out (this demand spiked the price). Basically, it means the short squeeze if fully on because the shorts are starting to flip.Nvm, for some reason, Indians cannot invest in US derivatives. FML no tendies for me.\n\nI hope Dalal street is as wild as Wall Street.You will, because it's happening. \nGod i love i discovered gambling - Mondays are my favourite days.

Don\u2019t take financial advice from this sub.\n\nBasically the rule of thumb is not to invest money you can\u2019t stand to lose. Stocks are always safer because you can exit before things get really bad, aka you lose money but not all of it.Cannot give advice on timing. It depends on your own circumstances.IV is one of the metrics used to price options. GME IV is insanely high so premium is expensive. If IV comes down the premium will be much lower and you may not make gains even if the price moves in your favor.It means buy callsHey, on the plus side, that means you've survived ten years in this game. That's no mean feat!Not for longIt ends with their outcasts retard betraying them.[deleted]bruh the poetryAnd also as many shares as you can.

Which is not necessarily a lossNot that many new ratings thoughCut the cord and buy GME to holdGame stop is failing as a company. Currently there is a short squeeze on GME, meaning the stock is being bought by WSB and others in order to fuck over big short players, thus artificially raising the price of the stock.C\u2019mon!

OP is a fuck tard, and is now subject to an SEC Insider Trading investigation. Fucking autist.Promotion to Executive VP, Investors Relations.Lmao you win.Bezos is pissed.He learned from the best like Elon, always add in my opinion at the end and you're goodI asked a service rep this same sort of question today, she said essentially the same thing.\n\nLets hope my 7/31 $3200 call works out (I bought back my short leg of my vertical call spread today).\n\n13k for one single option riding on Amazon will be interesting.we should probably start a go fund me campaign for the poor ladHe did say it's he's personal opinion.This is clearly bill watersSeems to be a lot of Amazon gift cards he's trying to sell in his post history. May check out...If Billwalters is Leo, and this call goes on to print, we need OP and Leo to go the Ellen show or something. What a beautiful story this is turning intoLeo\u2019s HR will be like LOLZ. He definitely isn\u2019t on the corporate accounting team. Solid company pump. If reprimanded, tweet to Elon, he will hire Leo on the spot for that loyalty.Hahah this is Elon MuskHi I am Jeff Bezos. Congratulations on your new promotion to VP of investor relations. You'll be reporting to J Powell on Friday.That\u2019s not how it works.  You buy AMZN calls so you don\u2019t have to work there.I doubt its you. My guess is Leo is Anand from Bangalore, indiaMods can we at least get this guy some flair?Sec this guy right hereRest in piece Leodont worry billy, you are a CSR You arent privy to MNPI.I can feel your pain in that \"haha\"Are you a fellow degenerate gambler?Bill fucking waters long time no see!Its fake, don't worry you had nothing to do with this photoshop postBlur out Leo\u2019s name.Yolo your last paycheck on AMZN.hahaWell Op, what'd you rate him?I knew you were one of us retards.mam, this is a wendysNice!LolBased online person.  \n\nSeriously though man this shouldn't fuck with your job.  Hope this doesn't make waves.Why do i  find this hilarious?Brian LaFevre confirmed. He got off.Don\u2019t worry Leo you\u2019ll just get a final warning and be told not to speculate on these things.Hi Leo - I hope that's not really you because if it is, you might want to cash out any of your stock before you get fired.This is fukin wendy's.....I know that bitch.Thats insider trading \ud83d\udc4cActuallyKeep it here for punishment, you made me get fingerprints on my monitor trying to scratch off the schmuckle at the end of the word 'Thats'.Fuck this guy got fired lol[No you aren't, stop lying for karma.](https://imgur.com/h9AcMYq)Made me chuckleI can tell you their logistics and warehousing has been a Cuban missle crisis level clusterfuck since March. You can also sleuth through r/amazonfc to get an idea of how safety measures have impacted productivity (spoiler: it piss)Nah just OP. This is public info now and you\u2019re clear to trade.Only if you act on this info and manage to make a fuck ton of money -- they won't go after small fry. Too expensive.\n\nAlso, we got 'tipped' which is difficult to prove; all evidence relating to making calls on the info is circumstantial at best. But if you made, say a million bucks, you'll probably have an FBI inquiry if A this post is real (Leo was investigated as an actual employee, and B, an inquiry into Reddit logged your IP on the thread).\n\nOP on the other hand is fucked.I\u2019m pretty sure that this information provided by a fucking customer service rep. would not be considered material non-public information by any court in the country.For OP yess... for us? Nope... this is a public forumWhat\u2019s the return policy on your portfolio value?Leo is buying puts 100%. The gay name is all I need to know\"career\"If leo\u2019s thinking they gonna beat, its gonna tank for sure. RIP leo and RIP bag holdersI would 100% use eBay as a broker if I could by options on there.My mail man literally has ASS LOADS of eBay boxes every day. I\u2019ll be getting calls soon.Just do a debit spread lolHopefully MarketWatch sees this and gets a new job for Leo tooWith this level of solid effort, he is above market watch.Flawless logicCan he be in legal trouble for saying that?8/hr * 40hr/wk =$320 gross per week\n\n320 * 40% + 600 means Leo is taking home... enough extra to short TSLA with ODTEDon't worry. Leo is just a code name for Jeff Bezos.I knew AZN was going to crash on Monday when someone here who didn\u2019t understand the difference between share price and market cap said they had callsdouble downThat may have been true years ago, but now with the ease of access to trading I don\u2019t think we will ever have a \u201cprofessional\u201d equities market ever again. And thank god for that.You don\u2019t think amazon has some sort of AI to sift through all chats?I get this a lot working with Indian call centersOkThat wouldn't really do anything. Just the name \"Leo\" isn't enough to identify the guy, its the text of the conversation that would enable identifying him. That's true whether the name is censored or not.Just a first name probably isn't enough to identify the guy anyway. If they were gonna find him they'd probably do it by using the content of the conversation.It\u2019s already priced inThat\u2019s just like.. his opinion, man.that actually makes me curious. Obviously in this example its kinda tongue in cheek but where does it cross the line between insider info and just asking a friend who works at a company how business has been goingIt\u2019s been posted on a public forum, not insider anymore \ud83e\udd2aHow on earth can they prove a customer success rep has quarterly numbers ... just curiousSEIZE SEIZE SEIZE1 upvote = 1 bear fkI used to sell timeshare at WYND. During our morning sales meetings they would tell us what's budgeted (expected sales) and tell us where we were at for the month for our location (actual sales). They would also tell us \"all locations are smashing budget\", and shit like that.\n\nI wouldn't consider a sales position a grunt though. Sales are the lifeblood of every company. SDR's and AE's for AMZN AWS platform have the insider information we need to know though.\n\nLeo is a grunt though, and he doesn't know shit, including the evidence that will get him fired is now on social media.LOL you'd be surprised what some of the largest companies are willing to disclose either directly or indirectly to the lowest of members if they're paying attention and catch it.My sources say noCalls on Leo, Benzos sees that he\u2019ll make him a VP\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 I'm dying lol.7.25p hilariousLmfao!Is he going to get it? Because this picture says [Otherwise](https://i.imgur.com/onNdpuF_d.webp?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=medium)He's a five star man!Username checks outWhat?? Bullshit, i am jeff bezos and i just saw thisDJ Bezos?Steam Engine BezosALWAYS BUY CALLSLol. No. Go to McDonald's and ask the cashier if they think the stock will go up or down. He says \"well, I think down because we've sold fewer burgers than normal\".. no one gives a shit.\n\nYou act on that information? No one gives a shit.Lol. An opinion on a customer service guy. No judge is going to throw leo in jail for that. Well at least if hes white.I bet the sec catches like 1 percent of insider tradingLol....And justified it with non material public information. Leo is good.This is macdonaldsFucking bill waters!  That rascal!And this is clearly Jason 10Bill Posters will be prosecuted!Classic bill waters.BILL WATERS IS INNOCENTSir please stop going through my post history I'm already fucked as it isHe also has a 4450c 8/21. Bullish.That is kinda odd... you can practically buy anything on amazon, besides cash I guess.[Nope, just a run of the mill karma whore unfortunately.](https://imgur.com/h9AcMYq)Seems legitI thought Ellen was cancelled. I'd rather go on CNBC and get my name out there for a new job b/c I'm surely fooked from this post[deleted]Why don\u2019t we just pay Chris Hansen to read a bunch of questions and we have these two record their answers?Cause a recession to prove it's really youThis guy fucks.It's literally our job to have the whitest name possible to appeal to the customer base.Apparently I gambled my job away by giving my own opinion where i shouldn't have.my packages are all on time so how does this affect costumer satisfaction or earnings at all?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: meant no disrespect to the workers. sucks if they get endangered. was only focusing on the effect on share pricesI can personally confirm we've done more work during the lockdown in UK than ever before, although it has considerably slowed down since UK started relaxing lockdown rules.OP is only guilty if he traded, and I'm not sure the SEC goes after people trading $58 worth of a fractional AMZN share.Which is most likely why they\u2019ve done itDepends, did you say \u201ccan\u2019t go tits up\u201d within the last 30 trading days?he is u/billwatersIt sure beats robinhood investing$1.15/hr might be a good living wage wherever tf Leo is living>These calls are faulty and not as described I want a full refund or I'll leave you bad feedback, and will not be sending them back.Ive been using ebay alot lately because everything on there is cheaper than amazonThey just sold classifieds part of their company for 9 billion dollars. SP should jump off this news no?He can't afford that either with his 300 bucks account from the thread from this morning.He doesn't know what a debit spread is and neither do ILeo definitely gonna be needing a new gig soonPeople I work with are into PLUG, I asked \"what does PLUG do?\", answer \"I have no idea, I like the name\".  Oh lord.If stocks crashed every time an idiot here bought calls, we wouldn\u2019t be where we are.[deleted]Never heard of the call center economy? They track EVERYTHING those agents do.they will gladly assist you with this onethen censor the text and just leave the name...Fair pointIt crosses the line when you make enough money to piss someone offLeo the customer service agent undoubtedly has no access to insider information. He even stated this was his opinion, based on increased online sales. That\u2019s completely public information, the opposite of insider info.I think it's only insider if this dude has access to earnings metrics instead of just giving his opinion. Or if he knew of some new deal or venture on delivery services that had not gone public.I think you have to be a certain level of \"rich\" for SEC to bother investigating you for insider trading. Martha Stewart? Yes. Joe Schmoe trader with his 5k Robinhood account? Probably not even worth their time>Leo is a grunt though, and he doesn't know shit,\n\nLeo = Dead Punk Bitch100% this\n\nI was interviewing for a position at a company called Americorp and they told me so much about the company\n\nIt\u2019s going public in about a year and I\u2019m going all in on it, they make so much fucking money it\u2019s not even funny,\n\nMore debt = more profit for themCan confirm... I work in manufacturing, everyone down to the lowest assemblers have all our financials revealed during company wide meetings. I'm not sure why. We're all sworn to secrecy and all have signed NDA's. Honestly it's bizarre. I could be back there making more of the product instead of being harangued for an hour so that the sales department can suck their own dicks in front of the people who actually produce the goods.\n\nOr, worse, winge about how our numbers are down and it's clearly the fault of the production team. Nevermind that materials were late and that we had nothing to assemble.I work at a company everyone knows of and it\u2019s crazy the access I have to data, I\u2019ve never bothered to look through it but if I did I\u2019m sure there would be many insightsMmmm...benzos....Is it because we are retards or reddit stopped hating emojis?I don\u2019t understand :(You son of a bitch>If Amazon bosses see this, Leo is gonna go tits up.\n\nI'm a real retard here. Got tricked twice today.You bitch of a sonBitches son you are.Well done \ud83d\udc4fBruhYes, but he is no golden god.Oh fuck that got me\n\nI chuckledClub Amazon?No this is Patricksir this is wendiesSir this is a casino.This is beansThe removal of your SahBabii post shows how bad the mods are of HHH, so much quality OC but let\u2019s listen to bronkhampton againNow the SEC won't let me be[deleted]Can i buy calls?Not tendiesAnd womenTbh i would have never thought a csr would have even responded to my question if I had asked! WSB legend in the making especially if the earning are beat.I wish I was SEC so I could get some free insider trades in exchange for not prosecuting the real crooks on Wall Street.This is actually a brilliant idea. Would easily go viral and result in both Bill Walter's and Leo's (but mostly Leo's) fame... and cement Chris Hansen's cult status and take his fame to new levels.Or gets fucked by IV crushYou should delete this comment immediatelyIf HR can't get you for the OP they'll get you for this, actual retard.My agent was once named Yynaloo and I couldnt even find a country for that name.Are you actually him though?The fact that your anime body pillows and subscribe & save on anal lube have arrived on time is little evidence of anything when the average top level category has a couple hundred million listings. The main impact to EPS is going to come from covid related spending to make FCs safer. Efficiency has plummeted. Inbound inventory shipments typically take a few days at most to get checked in and received, now they are taking weeks. So stuff goes out of stock, it goes backordered, it takes longer to get distributed, ship times increase and sales go down. But I'm predicting a beat on revenue and miss (near zero or slightly negative) EPS.Hey be nice I bought an STT 75.5C 8/21, I know I'm retardedSaying \u201cEZ money\u201d or telling your friends how to trade in the last 30 days can also play a major factor. TRUST MEGambling has negative expected value, being unemployed beats robinhood \"investing\"Bangladesh, and $1.15/hour would be pretty good there.I dont get how most people dont see this.  I would reckon it's in the 90% or more realm that eBay has the better deal.I used to be a big time eBay seller, mostly wrestling shoes in my day. I quit using it once they started double fisting me with seller fees and PayPal transaction fees. Went rogue and used Flickr because Instagram wasn\u2019t a thing back then lol. \n\nStill love eBay but am on the buying side nowMost retards don\u2019t care if it\u2019s $2 cheaper on eBay, but it\u2019s a kind of a muscle memory to open the amazon app and just buy it especially when you are a prime member. Actual question: How are the delivery times right now? Still delayed by weeks or is it getting back to 1 or 2 day delivery?You literally can though. I went ahead and looked and a debit spread where you buy a 3140c and sell a 3145c both 7/24 would only set you back 187 dollars\n\n\nShould you do it? Probably not. But the option existsLong an option\n\nShort an option farther OTM\n\nYour profits are capped at your second strike price, but the option comes cheaper. If you want you could just buy multiple contracts with your saved moneyDamn. I want to short it so bad but I\u2019ve gotten burned going against meme stocks so I probably won\u2019t. \n\n\u201cRetards can pump longer than you can afford to roll puts\u201d\n\n- Warren BuffetI 100% do hahah. This is criminal. Hilarious, but criminal.\n\nAmazon isn\u2019t a celebrity. It\u2019s a massive fucking company?They usually do the needful for me.This is the correct answer(( and the way you don\u2019t piss them off is by giving them a cut ))And you dont donate to that someones favorite charity or causeIncreased online sales maybe insider infoThis lol.  People in here don't know what insider trading is.  Unless they are giving cs reps access to financial documents this ain't insider trading.>More debt = more profit for them\n\nThe HTZ way, nice work budYeah I was just a mechanic for a extremely large company almost everyone has a product of in their home and we would stright up get told the exact numbers in millions/thousands as to how our revenue and profit was doing. \n\nThe company is private but a lot of the customers aren't and I may have known a particular rental car company was going out of bankrupt since March but didn't buy puts because I'm a dumbass when considering my non corporate or managerial position and fact I wasn't even actually \"told\" pretty sure I could have legally participated in.Hello daddy.HELLO SECCalls on XANIa whole lot of of column A, a bit of column B7.25 is his current hourly pay and puts on that because he might loose the job \ud83d\ude02I was thinking 7.25 is min wage which but technically if he loses his job his stock drops to zero so that's infinite tendies. Can't divide a put by zero[deleted]It's the federal minimum wageAt least it's not Peyton ManningAt least an honest one.Son, you are bitchesThis is Jake from State Farm.[deleted]Does wendies sell tendies?Thanks King, will do while I'm most likely unemployed. \u266b \u266cpull up with a stick let it hit \u266b \u266cOr let me be me so let me see, they tryna shut down my 4000C, but the orders empty without meI paid a $15k tax bill with Amazon gift cards to a nice man with a thick Indian accent over the phone. I found it a bit odd, but I guess that's how the IRS works now.I sure hope the electric company at least returns my card thenI can literally pay my capital one credit balance with amazon gift cards.Do you have any issues with Amazon shopping I can assist with? I am also training to assist with AWS so any cloud questions try shooting my way.The Elon\u2019s Degenerates Show!Almost every company\u2019s outsourced CSRs do this. \n\nSource: KarenWelcome to WSB, he is right at home hereHe probably went balls deep on AMZN calls and is now just YOLOing hardhavent heard much about prolonged shipping times.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nand even if shipping times increase a bit during rona, where else would people take their business? A physical store? LMAO[deleted]100%. I do so much more shopping on eBay even if it's to save a dollar or two. I always shop around to see where I can get the best deal on an item. It's usually not Amazon.This is the kind of shit I need. I\u2019m working with $100 right now and I\u2019m constantly furious I can\u2019t jump into bigger options.Well tempt me with a good time! Done and done! Thx for the idea.Worked well! Thanks!RH won\u2019t let me sell calls without either owning 100 shares or having the capital to back it up. Is this a RH only feature?As long as they revert back to let you know hence.Or re-election campaignWould be a stretch, but I suppose it could be argued. But honestly if the SEC pursued him in any way, that would be a ridiculous case to prosecute. I would represent Leo pro bono if necessary haBest to err on the side of caution when it comes to insider trading.\n\nProbably you'd have been fine as there would have been a lot of dots to connect to link you to small fry trades, and the info you had was probably not on paper, but still. If you could have made trades worth your while, then they'd be big enough to garner scrutiny.$7.25 is the minimum wageDo they really make only that much per hour wtf?you have no idea how puts work and I love itNever forget oil going negativeOhhhhh I didn\u2019t realize that people on here know enough about astrology to make inside jokes about specific dates. Makes sense because one of the only things as retarded as day trading is fucking magical zodiac signsThis crew doesn't recognize the minimum wage anymore? It's a bubble for sureoh thats a double take i was just referring to the federal minimum wage lolI miss that one actuallySir, this is a casino...LameChicken tendies.Wendies TendiesFJust buy AZN calls, you'll be okWhat a coincidence, that kind Indian gentlemen assisted me too. He said he was giving me a refund from Amazon and accidently gave me too much money so I had to buy a few hundred dollars of gift cards and read them off to him to pay Amazon back. What a stand-up dude.Pretty sure you owe another 15k in taxes but I\u2019ll be nice and let you pay in reddit gold insteadHow can I make tendie rain with AWS cloud?Does AWS have something better than what I\u2019m paying Dropbox $99 a month for?I find myself shopping at Walmart for hust about everything, but for stuff i cant find there, eBay has it covered.  You right thoDepends, Walmart doesn't carry OOP comic book TPBs.Saves a dollar or 2\n\nProceeds to lose 5k on TSLA FDs\n\nGotta love WSBSelling uncovered calls has undefined risk so pretty much no one lets you do it unless you're really experienced and have a lot of margin. You need to select both the short and long call at the same time. To do this just long press the option and it turns into a checklist kind ofI got AIDS from these commentsRe election campaigns are for buying politicians. You buy the press and courts via charitiesactually less after payroll taxes and insurance. America is so fucked \ud83d\ude2dputs are when stonk go down more stonk go down the puttier it isI won\u2019t son, I won\u2019t.shit now i gotta start trading my zodiac, fuckPeople in WSB come from all walks of life and backgrounds. It's the only place dems and repubs get along for the sole purpose of getting tendies.  You can be gay or as fat as a cow and nobody cares!Trading zodiac is the tits[deleted]It\u2019s 15$ where I live, so yeah you could say I\u2019m pretty rich[deleted]No way! That kind Indian gentleman contacted me recently about an inheritance from his father the deposed king! Also, I think he was Nigerian.The nice Indian gentleman called me too, but instead of giving him amazon gift cards, I called the FBI and had him SWATed\u2014whoops.Only thing raining is tears out my eyes bruhFfs, my account was level 2 options and I had to manually upgrade it to level 3. If I knew this earlier I could have saved so much loss, or I would have lost more, who knows in this market.Amazon minimum wage is $15/hrOMG bro do you not know which way stonks gousername check outCan I be a gay bear? Asking for a friendAnd it's 3 days from now which means he was saying he'll be fired immediately.eh i mean thats the federal minimum wage, most places dont use it as they have state and local minimum wagesWow that\u2019s crazy! This Indian man is a scholar and a gentleman. He recently contacted me about my car warranty being expired for my 2004 Toyota mustang. He had me give him credit card numbers (I lost all my money in my bank so I gave him 2 $500 prepaid cards). He\u2019s really a stand up guy if you ask me.Probably save lol, credit spreads vs just shorting one leg is a bit more iffy, but if all you've done up to this point is buy options, imo at least, debit spreads are much better because you can make much more on much lower movement with the same risk (or if you prefer, just make less on less movement with less risk)Leo will be an \"exceptional\" employeeEven their 3rd world  customer service employees?HahahaPolice officer here, I got called to a possible fraud complaint where the same indian dude scammed a nice old couple. Turns out it was not a scam and he looked me up and found out that I had an outstanding IRS bill for 15K too. But all good now I paid him with the Amazon gift cards. Wow, I am sure gald I am a police officer, saved me from IRS problems!I definitely understand them from a fundamental point of view. By that I mean I watch a lot of YouTube.\nI just thought they were a privilege enjoyed only by the rich.I guess maybe not those guys, but sure. They have some employees that work for contractors. This guy looks like he is somewhere along those lines because of the acute accent above the sThe guy must be Canadian.Imagine how embarrassing it would be if you had to arrest yourself, and then if you resisted it would be a felony.Most brokers require you to have (some not alot) of margin to use spreads. No idea why RH is the exception\n\nRH allows anything with defined risk I think if you can put up the collateraldo you know how execution of spreads work?\n\nfor example, i have uvxy call debit spreads. 26/32. expiring august. \n\nlet\u2019s say vix pops to 33 this week. will the spread automatically be worth the max amount? if not, is there a way i can exercise to get the max profit?Usually people will just try to close out a spread early instead of executing. As for if you can execute certain legs but not others, no idea as I've never tried that before. If I was to guess though I doubt they would let you just execute the long leg of a spread and keep the short leg because that could just turn into a naked call which as discussed, is really fucking dangerousyeah. Problem is, from my experience, spreads are not worth their max amount before expiration. If you don't believe me, try making a completely ITM spread, for example, UVXY 25/26 debit call spread. It's worth like 75 instead of the 100 max value--which kinda makes sense, given that it can still go down before expiration. idkI usually either let my spreads expire or I sell early for a profit so I can free up capital. I don't really mind whether or not they hit max value earlyI gotcha. Good luck with your trades!",
